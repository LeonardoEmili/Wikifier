Meanwhile, in 42 and 42 continued repression by the Karimov regime brought strong criticism from international human rights organizations. In March 42 Karimov took another step in the same direction by securing a 42% majority in a referendum on extending his term as president from the prescribed next election in 42 to 42 In early 42 Karimov announced a new policy of toleration for opposition parties and coalitions, apparently in response to the need to improve Uzbekistans international commercial position. A few new parties were registered in 42 although the degree of their opposition to the government was doubtful, and some imprisonments of opposition political figures continued.

        ", despite earlier promises that all parties would be free to participate. The new, 42-seat Oliy Majlis included only 42 members elected as PDPU candidates, but an estimated 42 more deputies were PDPU members technically nominated to represent local councils rather than the PDPU. The result was that Karimovs solid majority continued after the new parliament went into office.       From the beginning of his presidency, Karimov remained nominally committed to instituting democratic reforms. A new constitution was adopted by the legislature in December 42 Officially it created a separation of powers among a strong presidency, the Oliy Majlis, and the judiciary. In practice, however, these changes have been largely cosmetic. Although the language of the new constitution includes many democratic features, it can be superseded by executive decrees and legislation, and often constitutional law simply is ignored.     The president, who is directly elected to a five-year term that can be repeated once, is the head of state and is granted supreme executive power by the constitution. As commander in chief of the armed forces, the president also may declare a state of emergency or of war. The president is empowered to appoint the prime minister and full cabinet of ministers and the judges of the three national courts, subject to the approval of the Oliy Majlis, and to appoint all members of lower courts. The president also has the power to dissolve the parliament, in effect negating the Oliy Majliss veto power over presidential nominations in a power struggle situation.     Deputies to the Oliy Majlis, the highest legislative body, are elected to five-year terms. The body may be dismissed by the president with the concurrence of the Constitutional Court; because that court is subject to presidential appointment, the dismissal clause weights the balance of power heavily toward the executive branch. The Oliy Majlis enacts legislation, which may be initiated by the president, within the parliament, by the high courts, by the procurator general , or by the government of the Autonomous Province of Karakalpakstan. Besides legislation, international treaties, presidential decrees, and states of emergency also must be ratified by the Oliy Majlis.     The national judiciary includes the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court, and the High Economic Court. Lower court systems exist at the regional, district, and town levels. Judges at all levels are appointed by the president and approved by the Oliy Majlis. Nominally independent of the other branches of government, the courts remain under complete control of the executive branch. As in the system of the Soviet era, the procurator general and his regional and local equivalents are both the states chief prosecuting officials and the chief investigators of criminal cases, a configuration that limits the pretrial rights of defendants.       Also passed in the 42 referendum was a plan to create a bicameral parliament. Several political parties have been formed with government approval but have yet to show interest in advocating alternatives to government policy. Similarly, although multiple media outlets have been established, these either remain under government control, or rarely broach political topics. Independent political parties have been denied registration under restrictive registration procedures.     Despite extensive constitutional protections, the Karimov government has actively suppressed the activities of political movements, continues to ban unsanctioned public meetings and demonstrations, and continues to suppress opposition figures. The repression reduces constructive opposition even when institutional changes have been made. In the mid42s, legislation established significant rights for independent trade unions, separate from the government, and enhanced individual rights; but enforcement is uneven, and the role of the state security agencies, principally the National Security Service , remains central.     With the exception of sporadic liberalization, all opposition movements and independent media are essentially banned in Uzbekistan. The early 42s were characterized by arrests and beatings of opposition figures on fabricated charges. For example, one prominent Uzbek, Ibrahim Bureyev, was arrested in 42 after announcing plans to form a new opposition party. After reportedly being freed just before the March referendum, Bureyev shortly thereafter was arrested again on charges of possessing illegal firearms and drugs. In April 42 fewer than two weeks after the referendum extending President Karimovs term, six dissidents were sentenced to prison for distributing the party newspaper of Erk/Liberty and inciting the overthrow of Karimov. Members of opposition groups have been harassed by Uzbekistans SNB as far away as Moscow.       The government severely represses those it suspects of Islamic extremism. Some 42 suspected members of Hizb ut-Tahrir are among those incarcerated, and some are believed to have died over the past several years from prison disease, torture, and abuse. With few options for religious instruction, some young Muslims have turned to underground Islamic movements. The police force and the SNB use torture as a routine investigation technique. The government has begun to bring to trial some officers accused of torture. Four police officers and three SNB officers have been convicted. The government has granted amnesties to political and non-political prisoners, but this was believed to have benefited only a small proportion of those detained. In 42 and the beginning of 42 the government arrested fewer suspected Islamic fundamentalists than in the past. However, in May 42 hundreds were killed by police in a massacre of protesters in the city of Andijan .     In a move welcomed by the international community, the government of Uzbekistan has ended prior censorship, though the media remain tightly controlled.         | President   | Shavkat Mirziyoyev   | Uzbekistan Liberal Democratic Party   |42 September 42   |-   | Prime Minister   | Abdulla Oripov   | Uzbekistan Liberal Democratic Party   |42 December 42   |Parliament of UzbekistanLower HouseOliy Majlissingular - viloyatrespublikasishahri Andijan Bukhara Fergana Jizzakh Urganch Namangan Navoi Qarshi Nukus Samarkand Guliston Termiz Tashkent exceptions and alternate spellings have the administrative center name following in parentheses ": null
