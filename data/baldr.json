        ", in his  Teutonic Mythology  , identifies Old Norse Baldr with the Old High German Baldere , Palter , Paltar and with Old English bealdor, baldor lord, prince, king . Old Norse shows this usage of the word as an honorific in a few cases, as in baldur î brynju  and herbaldr , epithets of heroes in general.     Grimm traces the etymology of the name to balþaz, whence Gothic balþs, Old English bald, Old High German pald, all meaning bold, brave . Baldrs would in strictness appear to have no connexion with the Goth. balþs , nor Paltar with the OHG. pald, nor Baldr with the ON. ballr dangerous, dire. As a rule, the Gothic ld is represented by ON. ld and OHG. lt: the Gothic lþ by ON. ll and OHG. ld. But the OS. and AS. have ld in both cases, and even in Gothic, ON. and OHG. a root will sometimes appear in both forms in the same language; so that a close connexion between balþs and Baldrs, pald and Paltar, is possible after all.     But the interpretation of Baldr as the brave god may be secondary. Baltic  has a word meaning the white, the good , and Grimm speculates that the name may originate as a Baltic loan into ": null

This, as Grimm points out, would agree with the meaning shining one, white one, a god derived from the meaning of Baltic baltas, further adducing Slavic  Belobog  and German  Berhta . Bæl-dæg itself is white-god, light-god, he that shines as sky and light and day, the kindly Bièlbôgh, Bèlbôgh of the Slav system. It is in perfect accord with this explanation of Bæl-dæg, that the Anglo-Saxon tale of ancestry assigns to him a son Brond, of whom the Edda is silent, brond, brand, ON. brandr , signifying jubar, fax, titio. Bældæg therefore, as regards his name, would agree with Berhta, the bright goddess.     Grimms etymology is endorsed by modern research.
