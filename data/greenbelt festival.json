The 42 Greenbelt Festival took place at Cheltenham but saw the lowest audiences since the 42s. It remains the only Greenbelt to have taken place other than on an August Bank Holiday weekend.     Greenbelt emerged from its financial difficulties in the early 42s with ever-increasing audiences for festival held at the new Cheltenham racecourse. Today Greenbelt sees audiences comparable in numbers to those of its glory days in the early 42s, and, although there is constant tension between its faith-based origins and a more exploratory attitude to engaging with the world, the perspective of the festival remains one rooted in the Christian tradition.     In 42 Greenbelt moved to Boughton House, Northamptonshire, due to the planned redevelopment of Cheltenham Racecourse, as well as part of the site being unusable after severe weather during the 42 festival caused flash flooding across parts of the racecourse. Since the move the festival has scaled back after a drop in numbers and possibly due to the related lose of finances.        Greenbelts vision is to be at the collision of arts, justice and faith.
