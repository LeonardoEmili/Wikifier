This conflict was recorded by Josephus, although he made no mention of the name of the Nabataean king. Josephus mentioned two campaigns against the Nabataeans, but did not explain the motives leading the Syrian King to attack them. Modern scholars presented several theories.

Shatzman, on the other hand, noted that nowhere in his work did Stephanus indicate that the battle of Motho took place in the north.     Taking advantage of his brothers absence, Philip I seized Damascus, aided by the governor of the citys citadel, Milesius, who opened the gates to him.

No coins were minted during the period that Philip I held Damascus, indicating only a brief occupation of the city.

The existence of the Yannai Line has been questioned by several historians, and Josephus explanation of Alexander Jannaeus attempt to stop the march of Antiochus XII, because of his fears of the latters intentions, is unsatisfactory. Both the Nabataeans and Syrians were enemies of Judea and it would have been to Alexander Jannaeus benefit if those two powers were in conflict. Syncellus may have been referring to an earlier confrontation between the Syrian king and Alexander Jannaeus. Thus the statement of Syncellus supports the notion that Antiochus XIIs second Nabataean campaign was also aimed at Judea; perhaps Antiochus XII sought to annex the coastal cities of Alexander Jannaeus as a retribution for the defeat mentioned by Syncellus. Another objective would be subduing the Judaeans to keep them from attacking Syria while Antiochus XII was busy in Nabataea.
