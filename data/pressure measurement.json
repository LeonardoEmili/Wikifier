A manometer is a good example, as it uses the surface area and weight of a column of liquid to both measure and indicate pressure. Likewise the widely used Bourdon gauge is a mechanical device, which both measures and indicates and is probably the best known type of gauge.     A vacuum gauge is a pressure gauge used to measure pressures lower than the ambient atmospheric pressure, which is set as the zero point, in negative values . Most gauges measure pressure relative to atmospheric pressure as the zero point, so this form of reading is simply referred to as gauge pressure . However, anything greater than total vacuum is technically a form of pressure. For very accurate readings, especially at very low pressures, a gauge that uses total vacuum as the zero point may be used, giving pressure readings in an ": null

In other cases measurements are made relative to a vacuum or to some other specific reference.

These are further divided into two subcategories: high and low vacuum . The applicable pressure ranges of many of the techniques used to measure vacuums have an overlap.

        ", gauge pressure measurement prevails. Pressure instruments connected to the system will indicate pressures relative to the current atmospheric pressure. The situation changes when extreme vacuum pressures are measured, then absolute pressures are typically used instead.     Differential pressures are commonly used in industrial process systems. Differential pressure gauges have two inlet ports, each connected to one of the volumes whose pressure is to be monitored. In effect, such a gauge performs the mathematical operation of subtraction through mechanical means, obviating the need for an operator or control system to watch two separate gauges and determine the difference in readings.     Moderate vacuum pressure readings can be ambiguous without the proper context, as they may represent absolute pressure or gauge pressure without a negative sign. Thus a vacuum of 42  inHg gauge is equivalent to an absolute pressure of 42  inHg − 42  inHg 42  inHg.     Atmospheric pressure is typically about 42  ": null
