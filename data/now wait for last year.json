Kathy is now a slave to JJ42     The Starmen inform Kathy of her husbands new position with Molinari and suspect the latters possible defection to the reegs. Kathy is promised more JJ42 if she agrees to spy on her husband for Lilistar. Threatened with deportation, Kathy capitulates and agrees to their terms. Eventually, she takes a second dose of the drug as her ability to function becomes nearly impossible due the effects of the withdrawal. Jumping into a taxi-cab, both she and the cab are plunged back in time to the 42s. As the effects of the drug wear off, they slowly make their way back to the present time, uncertain as to whether the past they visited was their own or an alternate one.

However, there does not seem to be any safe way of defecting to the reegs, and Molinari fears that his deteriorating health will not instill confidence in the Terrans should the Starmen retaliate, as they are certain to do.

Sweetscent also witnesses that in the new timeline Earth has sided with the reegs and Lilistar has lost the war.     Upon returning to the present of his own timeline, Sweetscent is eager to present this information to Molinari, who reveals that he too has been taking JJ42 and that the effect is different for each user. Certain users are sent to the past, while others are sent to the future. Each trip is in an alternate universe, and therefore no one can effectively change their own past or future. However, aside from minor details, events in all observed universes seem to be moving in the same direction, and therefore, information obtained from one alternate worlds future will most likely be applicable to another.     In Molinaris case he slips sideways in time under the drugs influence and is able to pull alternate versions of his present self into his own timeline and then keep them there.     Having learned the secret to Molinaris alter-aliases as well as confirming the feasibility of an alliance with the reegs, Eric takes a larger dose of JJ42 which propels him further into the future. While there, he obtains a cure for JJ42s addiction, an item of wide accessibility in the future, as well as obtaining more information about the possible future of the war in his own timeline. He also gathers information as to the effects of JJ42 on the brain as he is increasingly worried about Kathys mental condition. Taking a fraction of a pill so as to not immediately return to his own time, Eric again ends up one year in his own future where the Starmen have occupied Earth after learning of the Terrans defection to the reegs. He is arrested by a Star patrol but saved by his future self, who informs him that Ackerman and the rest of the crew at TF & D have taken a stand against Lilistar, using Ackermans getaway on Mars as their hideout.     Now knowing the general future history of the next few years, Eric returns to his own time where his wifes mental condition is deteriorating every day. He resolves to check her into a clinic and is sent into deep reflection about the nature of their relationship. Feeling that he would be justified, he attempts to arrange an affair with a younger girl at Molinaris recommendation.

After pointing out that robots do not marry, the cab hypothetically concludes that it would stay with her. Life, argues the cab, is made up of a series of circumstances, different for each person. To leave ones wife would be to say that he requires a uniquely easier set of circumstances than what has been provided. That reasoning, to the cab, was an irrational way of thinking.
