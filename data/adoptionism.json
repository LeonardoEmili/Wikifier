The low Christology or adoptionist Christology is the belief that God exalted Jesus to be his Son by raising him from the dead,  thereby raising him to divine status.  The other early Christology is high Christology, which is the view that Jesus was a pre-existent divine being who became a human, did the Father’s will on earth, and then was taken back up into heaven whence he had originally come,  and from where he ": null

Since the 1970s, the late datings for the development of a high Christology have been contested, and a majority of scholars argue that this High Christology existed already before the writings of Paul. This incarnation Christology or high Christology did not evolve over a longer time, but was a big bang of ideas which were already present at the start of Christianity, and took further shape in the first few decades of the church, as witnessed in the writings of Paul.  Larry Hurtado ,      According to Ehrman, these two Christologies existed alongside each other, calling the low Christology an adoptionist Christology, and the high Christology an incarnation Christology.
