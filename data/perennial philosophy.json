Following Schleiermacher, an individuals intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth. In the late 42th and early 42th century, the first translations of Hindu texts appeared, which were also read by the Transcendentalists, and influenced their thinking. They also endorsed universalist and Unitarianist ideas, leading to Unitarian Universalism , the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well, since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.           By the end of the 42th century, the idea of a perennial philosophy was popularized by leaders of the Theosophical Society such as H. P. Blavatsky and Annie Besant , under the name of Wisdom-Religion or Ancient Wisdom .     The Theosophical Society took an active interest in Asian religions, subsequently not only bringing those religions under the attention of a western audience but also influencing Hinduism and Buddhism in Sri Lanka and Japan.           Many perennialist thinkers are influenced by Hindu reformer Ram Mohan Roy and Hindu mystics Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda , Prothero p.42 who themselves have taken over western notions of universalism. They regarded Hinduism to be a token of this perennial philosophy. This notion has influenced thinkers who have proposed versions of the perennial philosophy in the 42th century.     The unity of all religions was a central impulse among Hindu reformers in the 42th century, who in turn influenced many 42th-century perennial philosophy-type thinkers. Key figures in this reforming movement included two Bengali Brahmins. Ram Mohan Roy , a philosopher and the founder of the modernising Brahmo Samaj religious organisation, reasoned that the divine was beyond description and thus that no religion could claim a monopoly in their understanding of it.     The mystic Ramakrishna s spiritual ecstasies included experiencing the sameness of Christ, Mohammed and his own Hindu deity. Ramakrishnas most famous disciple, Swami Vivekananda , travelled to the United States in the 42s where he formed the Vedanta Society .     Roy, Ramakrishna and Vivekananda were all influenced by the Hindu school of Advaita Vedanta , Prothero, Stephen God is Not One: The Eight Rival Religions That Run the World—and Why Their Differences Matter, p. 4242 HarperOne, which they saw as the exemplification of a Universalist Hindu religiosity.           The Traditionalist School is a group of 42th and 42st century thinkers concerned with what they considered to be the demise of traditional forms of knowledge, both aesthetic and spiritual, within Western society. The principal thinkers in this tradition are René Guénon , Ananda Coomaraswamy and Frithjof Schuon . Other important thinkers in this tradition include Titus Burckhardt , Martin Lings , Jean-Louis Michon , Marco Pallis , Huston Smith , Hossein Nasr , Jean Borella , Elémire Zolla and Julius Evola . According to the Traditionalist School, orthodox religions are based on a singular metaphysical origin. According to the Traditionalist School, the philosophia perennis designates a worldview that is opposed to the scientism of modern secular societies and which promotes the rediscovery of the wisdom traditions of the pre-secular developed world . This view is exemplified by Rene Guenon in ": null
