If F is an algebraically closed field and n is a natural number, then F contains all nth roots of unity, because these are the n zeroes of the polynomial x n    & minus;  1. A field extension that is contained in an extension generated by the roots of unity is a cyclotomic extension, and the extension of a field generated by all roots of unity is sometimes called its cyclotomic closure. Thus algebraically closed fields are cyclotomically closed. The converse is not true.
