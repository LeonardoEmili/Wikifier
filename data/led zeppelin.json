In the later stages of the bands career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard. Plant would then add lyrics before Page and Bonham developed their parts.        Early lyrics drew on the bands blues and folk roots, often mixing lyrical fragments from different songs.
