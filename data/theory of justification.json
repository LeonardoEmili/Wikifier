In much the same way arguments and explanations may be confused with each other, so may explanations and justifications. Statements that are justifications of some action take the form of arguments. For example, attempts to justify a theft usually explain the motives .     It is important to be aware when an explanation is not a justification. A criminal profiler may offer an explanation of a suspects behavior , and such statements may help us understand why the person committed the crime. An uncritical listener may believe the speaker is trying to gain sympathy for the person and his or her actions, but it does not follow that a person proposing an explanation has any sympathy for the views or actions being explained. This is an important distinction because we need to be able to understand and explain terrible events and behavior in attempting to discourage it. Critical Thinking, Parker and Moore       There are several different views as to what entails justification, mostly focusing on the question How sure do we need to be that our beliefs correspond to the actual world? Different theories of justification require different amounts and types of evidence before a belief can be considered justified. Theories of justification generally include other aspects of epistemology, such as knowledge.     Popular theories of justification include:   ": null

That is, it regards the justification of a claim as primary, while the claim itself is secondary. By contrast, non-justificational criticism works towards attacking claims themselves.     Bartley also refers to a third position, which he calls critical rationalism in a more specific sense, claimed to have been Poppers view in his Open Society. It has given up justification, but not yet adopted non-justificational criticism. Instead of appealing to criteria and authorities, it attempts to describe and explicate them.     ": null
