Contemporary scholars often reject Pauline authorship for the epistle to the Hebrews, Ehrman, Bart D. . The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings. Oxford University Press. p. 323. Scholars in the ancient world went about detecting forgeries in much the same way that modern scholars do. They looked to see whether the ideas and writing style of a piece conformed with those used by the author in other writings, and they examined the text for any blatant anachronisms, that is, statements about things that could not have existed at the time the alleged author was writing - Arguments of this kind were used by some Christian scholars of the third century to show that Hebrews was not written by Paul or the Book of Revelation by John the son of Zebedee. Modern scholars, as we will see, concur with these judgments. To be sure, neither of these books can be considered a forgery. Hebrews does not claim to be written by Paul , and the John who wrote Revelation does not claim to be the son of Zebedee .
