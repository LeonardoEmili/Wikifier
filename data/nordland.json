Nordland is well known for the fishing of cod fish and fish farming of salmon . Main export markets are Germany , Scandinavia , Britain , Netherlands , Italy , Spain , France , Russia and Japan .     Tourism is important, mainly in the summer season, although there are some winter visitors looking for good skiing or wanting to see the Northern Lights, especially from February to April. Tourists are attracted by the scenic coast, especially Lofoten, which is also visited by many cruise ships in the summer, while the rest of the county often is ignored by tourists. Mountain hiking is popular among natives and some tourists.     Whale watching attracts tourists to Andøy and the Tysfjord / Lødingen / Svolvær area, and fishing is also popular along the coast and in the salmon and trout rivers; there is also Arctic char in some rivers. Saltstraumen has the world record for coalfish using a fishing rod , and Røst has the world record for halibut, 42  kg . thu , where the local hospital in Lofoten is situated.   thu . Nordland has the largest hydroelectric potential among Norways counties, and some powerintensive factories.     Farming is another regional economy, and consists mainly of dairy farming and livestock such as sheep , and domesticated reindeer graze the inland highlands. There is also some forestry, particularly in the Helgeland district, but also further north. In earlier days, grain was grown in Nordland . Nordlandshest is the smallest of the three Norwegian horse breeds. The Norwegian Lundehund was bred to hunt puffin s and only saved from extinction due to a few remaining dogs in Lofoten.     There is a long history of mining. Sulitjelma has the largest copper deposits in the county, as well as pyrite , the latter is also found in several other locations, but the mining here has been discontinued for economical reasons. In earlier days, silver was mined in the Dunderland Valley in Rana, and until 42 nickel and olivine was mined in Ballangen . There are several limestone, marble, and dolomite rock quarries, dolomite in Vefsn, Fauske, Sørfold and Ballangen. As of 42 mining of gold in Bindal is in testing stages .   The port of Narvik has a direct rail connection to the well known and profitable Kiruna - Gällivare iron -ore fields in Sweden . There are many dams for hydroelectric power.   Nordland has an increasing diverse economy, with fledgling research and development in aerospace and space exploration at the Andøya Rocket Range , which primarily is known for its satellite launches. This vast province, Norways second largest, almost the size of Denmark , traditionally was very important for NATO, and the Royal Norwegian Air Force has two squadrons of F42 fighters stationed at Bodø Airport , and all its P42 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft stationed at Andøya Air Station . The decommissioning of closing military bases has led to a regional shift towards a new knowledge based economy.   thu has an airport , railway station and a harbour within walking distance, and numerous hotels.   There are local hospitals in Mosjøen , Sandnessjøen , Mo i Rana , Bodø , Gravdal , Narvik and Stokmarknes .     thu connecting Alsten island to the mainland. With many deep fjord s, island s and strait s, Nordland is a county of bridges.     Bodø Airport is the busiest airport, and a hub for many smaller airports in Nordland. Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes in the north also has non-stop flights to Oslo . The E42 runs along the entire length of Nordland. There are many tunnels and bridges; some of the largest are Helgeland Bridge , Gimsøystraumen Bridge , Raftsund Bridge , Skjomen Bridge , Rombak Bridge , Hadsel Bridge , Sortland Bridge , Andøy Bridge , Saltstraumen Bridge , Kjellingstraumen Bridge and Brønnøysund Bridge . Even with improved communications, population numbers in Nordland has actually decreased slightly since 42 as many young people move to larger cities in Norway. Bodø is the only municipality in the county with a significant growth in population.       thu , 4242 from Rødøy , the other from Frosta .     There is evidence of human settlement in Nordland as far back as 42 years ago, about as early as in southern Norway. These Stone Age people lived near the coast, often on islands and typically along strait s near the open sea, with a rich provision of marine resources. Such archeological evidence has been found on Vega , in Leirfjord and along Saltstraumen . There are at least 42 locations with prehistoric rock carvings in Nordland, from Helgeland in the south to Narvik in the north .     Some of the oldest houses known in Norway were excavated on Langhågan on the island Sanna in Træna municipality; http://www.trana.kommune.no/nordland/trana/tranak.nsf/id/42AA42F42D42E42C42E42D42 the oldest house was oval, 42 x 42 m, and is dated to 42 BC. A 42-metre-long stone paved trail from the house down to a small harbour, today 42 m above sea level, is still visible.     The 42-year-old rock drawings at Rødøy , which depict a man on skis holding a stick, is the oldest known reference of skis being used. The location is somewhat surprising, as this island has unreliable snow cover, and the Scandinavian climate was warmer in the Stone Age.   This rock drawing was used as a pictogram in the Lillehammer Olympic Games in 42     The first agricultural culture has been dated to the Bronze Age . This culture left large burial cairns close to the sea, for instance in Steigen and Vestvågøy , and the northernmost location is around Harstad in southern Troms. These locations have significant areas of lowland suited for agriculture, they are close to the sea and they have many natural harbours.   thu .     The oldest remains of a boat ever found in Norway was discovered in a bog in Sømna . Known as Haugvikbåten, the well preserved piece, kept in the Museum of Science  in Trondheim, has been dated to 42–42 BC—the Nordic Bronze Age .     For many generations Hålogaland had been the northernmost area of Norse settlement. The remnants of large longhouses near Borg and in Steigen are dated to the Merovinger period . There are substantial archeological evidence of a Norse iron -based culture along the coast from approximately 42 AD.   thu   thu , Hamarøy , part of the Norwegian Cultural Heritage.     Nordland is regarded as part of Sápmi . The Sami , which are not of Norse origins, have lived in Nordland for at least 42 years. Not just inland, but also along the fjords and, in the northern part of Nordland, even on the coast and larger islands, such as Hinnøya. There is a story in Heimskringla about a Viking which became a contender for the throne, Sigurd Slembe . He was on the run from the king, and was helped by Sami in what is probably Lødingen municipality today. The sami even built him a boat, which the saga mention was made from pine wood . Tysfjord today is a centre for the Lule Sami culture.     The current county of Nordland was part of the petty kingdom of Hålogaland in the Viking era . This kingdom also included the southern part of Troms .     In January 42 an Italian trade ship going from Crete to Flanders was hit by a storm and taken far north where it was wrecked; some of the crew survived and came ashore on a small island near Røst . They were taken care of by the people of Røst. The story, told by one of the men, Pietro Querini , gives one of very few descriptions of life in Nordland in this time period . Querini sees the people of Røst as very trusting and good Catholic s, the inner circle of paradise": null
