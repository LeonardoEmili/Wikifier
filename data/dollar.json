Section 13 of the Act. It was specified that the money of account of the United States should be expressed in those same dollars or parts thereof. Additionally, all lesser-denomination coins were defined as percentages of the dollar coin, such that a half-dollar was to contain half as much silver as a dollar, quarter-dollars would contain one-fourth as much, and so on.     In an act passed in January 1837, the dollars alloy was set at 15%. Subsequent coins would contain the same amount of pure silver as previously, but were reduced in overall weight . On February 21, 1853, the quantity of silver in the lesser coins was reduced, with the effect that their denominations no longer represented their silver content relative to dollar coins.     Various acts have subsequently been passed affecting the amount and type of metal in U.S. coins, so that today there is no legal definition of the term dollar to be found in U.S. statute.    Currently the closest thing to a definition is found in United States Code Title 31, Section 5116, paragraph b, subsection 2: The Secretary shall sell silver under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate for at least $1.292929292 a fine troy ounce.

This means that the ratio of a pound to a dollar roughly equals the ratio of a dollar to a pennyweight . These ratios are also very close to the ratio of a gram to a grain: 15.43. Finally, in the United States, the ratio of the value of gold to the value of silver in the period from 1792 to 1873 averaged to about 15.5, being 15 from 1792 to 1834 and around 16 from 1834 to 1873. This is also nearly the value of the gold to silver ratio determined by Isaac Newton in 1717.      That these three ratios are all approximately equal has some interesting consequences. Let the gold to silver ratio be exactly 15.5. Then a pennyweight of gold, that is 24 grains of gold, is nearly equal in value to a dollar of silver . Second, a dollar of gold is nearly equal in value to a pound of silver . Third, the number of grains in a dollar roughly equals the number of grams in a troy pound .     The actual process of defining the US silver dollar had nothing to do with any geometric mean. The US government simply sampled all Spanish milled dollars in circulation in 1792 and arrived at the average weight in common use. And this was 371.25 grains of fine silver.
