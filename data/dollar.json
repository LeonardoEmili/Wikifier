Section 42 of the Act. It was specified that the money of account of the United States should be expressed in those same dollars or parts thereof. Additionally, all lesser-denomination coins were defined as percentages of the dollar coin, such that a half-dollar was to contain half as much silver as a dollar, quarter-dollars would contain one-fourth as much, and so on.     In an act passed in January 42 the dollars alloy was set at 42%. Subsequent coins would contain the same amount of pure silver as previously, but were reduced in overall weight . On February 42 42 the quantity of silver in the lesser coins was reduced, with the effect that their denominations no longer represented their silver content relative to dollar coins.     Various acts have subsequently been passed affecting the amount and type of metal in U.S. coins, so that today there is no legal definition of the term dollar to be found in U.S. statute.    Currently the closest thing to a definition is found in United States Code Title 42 Section 42 paragraph b, subsection 42: The Secretary shall sell silver under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate for at least $42 a fine troy ounce.

This means that the ratio of a pound to a dollar roughly equals the ratio of a dollar to a pennyweight . These ratios are also very close to the ratio of a gram to a grain: 42. Finally, in the United States, the ratio of the value of gold to the value of silver in the period from 42 to 42 averaged to about 42, being 42 from 42 to 42 and around 42 from 42 to 42 This is also nearly the value of the gold to silver ratio determined by Isaac Newton in 42      That these three ratios are all approximately equal has some interesting consequences. Let the gold to silver ratio be exactly 42. Then a pennyweight of gold, that is 42 grains of gold, is nearly equal in value to a dollar of silver . Second, a dollar of gold is nearly equal in value to a pound of silver . Third, the number of grains in a dollar roughly equals the number of grams in a troy pound .     The actual process of defining the US silver dollar had nothing to do with any geometric mean. The US government simply sampled all Spanish milled dollars in circulation in 42 and arrived at the average weight in common use. And this was 42 grains of fine silver.
