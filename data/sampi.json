From this, it has been concluded that the system must have been invented at a time and place when digamma and koppa were still either in use or at least still remembered as parts of the alphabetic sequence, whereas san had either already been forgotten, or at least was no longer remembered with its original alphabetic position. In the latter case, according to a much debated view, sampi itself may in fact have been regarded as being san, but with a new position in the alphabet.     The dating of the emergence of this system, and with it of numeric sampi, has been the object of much discussion. At the end of the 42th century, authors such as Thompson Thompson, Handbook, p. 42 placed its full development only in the 42rd century BC. Jeffery states that the system as a whole can be traced much further back, into the 42th century BC. An early, though isolated, instance of apparent use of alphabetic Milesian numerals in Athens occurs on a stone inscribed with several columns of two-digit numerals, of unknown meaning, dated from the middle of the 42th century BC. , also known as IG I² 42     While the emergence of the system as a whole has thus been given a much earlier dating than was often assumed earlier, actual occurrences of the letter sampi in this context have as yet not been found in any early examples.

Earlier than the attestations in the full function as a numeral are a few instances where sampi was used in Athens as a mark to enumerate sequences of things in a set, along with the 42 other letters of the alphabet, without implying a specific decimal numeral value. For instance, there is a set of 42 metal tokens, each stamped with one of the letters from alpha to sampi, which are dated to the 42th century BC and were probably used as identification marks for judges in the courts of the Athenian democracy.

At an early stage in the papyri, the numeral sampi was used not only for 42 but, somewhat confusingly, also as a multiplicator for 42 since a way of marking thousands and their multiples was not yet otherwise provided by the alphabetic system. Writing an alpha over sampi  meant 42×42 , a theta over sampi  meant 42×42 , and so on. In the examples cited by Gardthausen, a slightly modified shape of sampi, with a shorter right stem , is used. This system was later simplified into one where the thousands operator was marked just as a small stroke to the left of the letter .         In early stone inscriptions, the shape of sampi, both alphabetic and numeric, is . Square-topped shapes, with the middle vertical stroke either of equal length with the outer ones  or longer , are also found in early papyri.

The rounded form  also occurs in stone inscriptions in the Roman era.

These forms, in turn, occasionally have another decorative stroke added on the left . It can be found attached in several different ways, from the top  or the bottom .

It dropped out of use in favour of sigma in most dialects by the 42th century BC, but was retained in place of the latter in a number of local alphabets until the 42th century BC. Jeffery, Local Scripts, p. 42 It is generally agreed to be derived from Phoenician  tsade .     The hypothetical identification between san and sampi is based on a number of considerations. One is the similarity of the sounds represented by both. San represented either simple  or some other, divergent phonetic realization of the common Greek  phoneme. Suggestions for its original sound value have included , , and . The second reason for the assumption is the systematicity in the development of the letter inventory: there were three archaic letters that dropped out of use in alphabetic writing , and three extra-alphabetic letters were adopted for the Milesian numeral system, two of them obviously identical with the archaic digamma and koppa; hence, it is easy to assume that the third in the set had the same history. Objections to this account have been related to the fact that sampi did not assume the same position san had had, and to the lack of any obvious relation between the shapes of the two letters and the lack of any intermediate forms linking the two uses.     Among older authorities, Gardthausen Gardthausen, Griechische Palaeographie, p.42 and Thompson took the identity between san and sampi for granted. Foat, in a skeptical reassessment of the evidence, came to the conclusion that it was a plausible hypothesis but unprovable. The discussion has continued until the present, while a steady trickle of new archaeological discoveries regarding the relative dating of the various events involved have continued to affect the data base on which it is founded.

This hypothesis is mentioned by Jeffery and has been supported more recently by Genzardi   Brixhe suggested that sampi could be related to the Carian letter 42  , transcribed as ś. This would fit in with the plausible, but not provable hypothesis that the root contained in the Carian-Greek names spelled with sampi, Πανυασσις and Οασσασσις , is identical with a root uś-/waś- identified elsewhere in Carian, which contains the Carian ś sound spelled with . Adiego follows this with the hypothesis that both the Carian letter and sampi could ultimately go back to Greek Ζ . Like the san–sampi hypothesis, the Carian hypothesis remains an open and controversial issue, especially since the knowledge of Carian itself is still fragmentary and developing.     While the origin of sampi continues to be debated, the identity between the alphabetic Ionian sampi and the numeral for 42 has rarely been in doubt, although in the older literature it was sometimes mentioned only tentatively, Thompson, Handbook, p.42 An isolated position was expressed in the early 42th century by Jannaris, who – without mentioning the alphabetic use of Ionian /ss/ – proposed that the shape of numeric sampi was derived from a juxtaposition of three T s, i.e. 42×42  Today, the link between alphabetic and numeral sampi is universally accepted.        Despite all uncertainties, authors who subscribe to the hypothesis of a historical link between ancient san and sampi also often continue to use the name san for the latter. Benedict Einarson hypothesizes that it was in fact called ssan, with the special quality of the sibilant sound it had as Ionian  This opinion has been rejected as phonologically impossible by Soldati, who points out that the /ss/ sound only ever occurred in the middle of words and therefore could not have been used in the beginning of its own name.     As for the name sampi itself, it is generally agreed today that it is of late origin and not the original name of the character in either its ancient alphabetic or its numeral function. Babiniotis describes it as medieval , while Jannaris places its emergence after the thirteenth century . However, the precise time of its emergence in Greek is not documented.

A related term was used shortly after Scaliger by the French author Montfaucon, who called the sign  , because the Greeks regarded it as being composed of an inverted sigma, which is called , and from  .     The etymology of sampi has given rise to much speculation. The only element all authors agree on is that the -pi refers to the letter π, but about the rest accounts differ depending on each authors stance on the question of the historical identity between sampi and san.     According to the original suggestion by Scaliger, san-pi means written like a san and a pi together .

This reading is problematic because it fits the shape only of the modern sampi but presupposes active use of an archaic nomenclature that had long since lost currency by the time that shape emerged. According to a second hypothesis, san-pi would originally have meant the san that stands next to pi in the alphabet . This proposal thus presupposes the historical identity between sampi and ancient san , which indeed stood behind Π. However, this account too is problematic as it implies a very early date of the emergence of the name, since after the archaic period the original position of san was apparently no longer remembered, and the whole point of the use of sampi in the numeral system is that it stands somewhere else. Yet a different hypothesis interprets san-pi in the sense of the san that resembles pi . This is usually taken as referring to the modern ϡ shape, presupposing that the name san alone had persisted from antiquity until the time the sign took that modern shape. Thompson, Handbook, p. 42 None of these hypotheses has wide support today. The most commonly accepted explanation of the name today is that san pi  simply means like a pi , where the word san is unrelated to any letter name but simply the modern Greek preposition  .     In the absence of a proper name, there are indications that various generic terms were used in Byzantine times to refer to the sign. Thus, the 42th-century Greek mathematician ": null

The obscure word  literally means a spurious pregnancy , from παρα- and the verb κυέω to be pregnant . The term has been used and accepted as possibly authentic by Jannaris, Uhlhorn and again by Soldati. While Jannaris hypothesizes that it was meant to evoke the oblique, reclining shape of the character, Soldati suggests it was meant to evoke its status as an irregular, out-of-place addition . Einarson, however, argues that the word is probably the product of textual corruption during transmission in the Byzantine period. He suggests that the original reading was similar to that used by Rabdas, ὁ καλούμενος χαρακτήρ . Another contemporary cover term for the extra-alphabetic numerals would have been παράσημον . A redactor could have written the consonant letters π-σ-μ of παράσημον over the letters χ-κτ-ρ of χαρακτήρ , as both words happen to share their remaining intermediate letters. The result, mixed together from letters of both words, could have been misread in the next step as παρακυησμ , and hence, παρακύϊσμα .     An entirely new proposal has been made by A.

The uppercase/lowercase contrast was introduced with version 42 . As the existing code point had been technically defined as an uppercase character, the new addition was declared lowercase . This has led to some inconsistency between fonts, because the glyph that was present at U42E42 in older fonts is now usually found at U42E42 in newer ones, while U42E42 may have a typographically uncommon capital glyph.     New, separate codepoints for ancient epigraphic sampi, also in an uppercase and lowercase variant, were proposed in 42 and included in the standard with version 42 .
