Brenz published a response in 42 to which Vermigli began to prepare a rebuttal, but he died before he was able to complete it.       Vermigli was primarily a teacher of scripture rather than a systematic theologian, but his lasting influence is mostly associated with his doctrine of the Eucharist. This can be explained by the close relationship he saw between exegesis of scripture and theological reflection. Vermiglis method of biblical commentary, similar to that of Martin Bucer, was to include extended discussions of doctrinal topics treated by the biblical texts. Like other Protestants, he believed ": null

He saw value in the fathers because they had discovered insights into the scriptures that he might not have found, and because many of his Catholic opponents placed great weight on arguments from patristic authority. Often, though, he used the fathers as support for interpretations he had already reached on his own and was not concerned when his interpretation had no patristic precedent.        Vermigli is best known for his polemics against the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and for the Reformed doctrine of sacramental presence .

Vermigli saw God as sovereign over every event, and believed that all things, including evil, were used by him to accomplish his will.

Because all people have fallen into sin, the reprobating will of God treats them as by-nature fallen and deserving of damnation. Vermiglis formulation of reprobation as within Gods decree while distinct from his saving election was slightly different from Calvins. Calvin saw predestination to salvation and reprobation as two sides of a single decree. Vermiglis doctrine was to prove more influential in the Reformed confessions.
