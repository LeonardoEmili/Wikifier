A good example is Kuolema kuuntelee , which depicts Death, personified as a skeleton wearing a black coat, listening with a bowed head as a young man plays the violin.

There is a suggestion that Death is there for the old woman, but that he is pausing so the young man, possibly the dying womans son, can have time to finish his violin playing.        Simbergs famous painting  The Wounded Angel , too, is somewhat gloomy, its titular character appearing in the shape of a winged angel with a bandaged head, borne on a stretcher by two somberly dressed boys, one of whom looks toward the viewer with a serious expression. The painting is the best known of the artists works and is especially famous in Finland. The Finnish ": null
