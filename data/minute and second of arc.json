To adjust a  mil scope 0.9 mil down and 0.4 mil right, the scope needs to be adjusted 9 clicks down and 4 clicks right .     One thing to be aware of is that some MOA scopes, including some higher-end models, are calibrated such that an adjustment of 1 MOA on the scope knobs corresponds to exactly 1 inch of impact adjustment on a target at 100 yards, rather than the mathematically correct 1.047 . This is commonly known as the Shooters MOA or Inches Per Hundred Yards . While the difference between one true MOA and one SMOA is less than half of an inch even at 1000 yards,  this error compounds significantly on longer range shots that may require adjustment upwards of 20–30 MOA to compensate for the bullet drop. If a shot requires an adjustment of 20 MOA or more, the difference between true MOA and SMOA will add up to 1 inch or more. In competitive target shooting, this might mean the difference between a hit and a miss.     The physical group size equivalent to m minutes of arc can be calculated as follows: group size tan  ×  distance.

        " is at a range that is in metres equal to the objects size in millimetres . So there is no conversion factor required, contrary to the MOA system. A reticle with markings spaced with a one mil apart are collectively called a mil reticle. If the markings are round they are called mil-dots.     In the table below conversions from mil to metric values are exact , while conversions of minutes of arc to both metric and imperial values are approximate.            ≈ 1.047 inches   1′ ≈ 0.291  mil   1  mil ≈ 3.44′, so   mil ≈ ′   0.1  mil equals exactly 1  cm at 100  m, or approximately 0.36 inches at 100 yards       In humans, ": null
