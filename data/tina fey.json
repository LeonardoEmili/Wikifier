Writing that Harding misunderstood Feys intentions, the author concluded that her self-deprecation is precisely what makes her relatable , elaborating that have many moments of self-doubt, and seeing someone as successful as Tina Fey be self-deprecating gives us all permission to be imperfect. Sophie Caldecott of  Verily  defended Feys modesty and tendency to downplay her own physical appearance: She mocks her own appearance, sure, but she does so in a way that consistently shows up our culture for placing so much importance on how women look, as if thats the most interesting thing about us ... Her comic persona on 42 Rock, Liz Lemon, can be laughed at for many things, but her career managerial style and ability is not one of them.  Caldecott concluded, In reality, self-deprecation is an art that comedians everywhere dabble in ... In fact, I defy you to find a good male comedian who isnt a master of self-deprecation. Comedians make fun of themselves for many reasons, mostly because it is the most readily accessible source of inspiration but also because it is the most generous one. Observing that Feys material lacks whining , Gina Barreca of the  Hartford Courant  wrote that Feys comedy is not simply an iteration of self-deprecating femininity passing itself off as humor. In itself, this demarcates the current generation of female humorists from earlier generations of performers who were told, more or less, to use themselves not as a sounding board for ideas but as a punching bag for insults.  Fey has also garnered criticism for being politically incorrect, but she defends her right to write borderline jokes, saying that she has chosen to opt out of the culture of demanding apologies.
