The virions contain two to three major structural proteins , which either are embedded in the membrane or form spikes distributed randomly on the external membrane surface.

Despite this discovery, until relatively recently it was believed that most DNA viruses contained double-stranded DNA . Recent work, however, has shown that single-stranded DNA viruses can be highly abundant in seawater , freshwater , sediment s, terrestrial and extreme environments, as well as metazoa n-associated and marine microbial mat s. Many of these environmental viruses belong to the family Microviridae . However, the vast majority has yet to be classified and assigned to genera and higher taxa. Because most of these viruses do not appear to be related, or are only distantly related to known viruses, additional taxa will have to be created to accommodate them.     ;Archaea     Although ~50 archaeal viruses are known, all but two have double stranded genomes.

        "       A division of the circular single stranded viruses into four types has been proposed. This division seems likely to reflect their phylogenetic relationships.     Type I genomes are characterized by a small circular DNA genome , with the Rep protein and the major open reading frame in opposite orientations. This type is characteristic of the circoviruses, geminiviruses and nanoviruses.     Type II genomes have the unique feature of two separate Rep ORFs.     Type III genomes contain two major ORFs in the same orientation. This arrangement is typical of the anelloviruses.     Type IV genomes have the largest genomes of nearly 4-kb, with up to eight ORFs. This type of genome is found in the Inoviridae and the Microviridae.     Given the variety of single stranded viruses that have been described this scheme—if it is accepted by the ICTV—will need to be extended.         All known eukaryotic ssDNA viruses also form icosahedral capsids. With the exception of the family Bidnaviridae and Anelloviridae, all eukaryotic ssDNA viruses encode homologous rolling-circle replication initiation proteins with characteristic N-terminal endonuclease domains and C-terminal superfamily three helicase domains. Krupovic M Networks of evolutionary interactions underlying the polyphyletic origin of ssDNA viruses. Current Opinion in Virology 3: 578–586 A name for this group of viruses has been proposed—circular Rep-encoding single-strand DNA viruses. It has been proposed that CRESS-DNA viruses have evolved from bacterial plasmids, from which they inherited the Rep genes.         A group of ssDNA viruses whose Rep proteins show homology to ssDNA viruses from the families Geminiviridae, Circoviridae, and Nanoviridae, while their coat protein is related to those of ssRNA viruses from the family Tombusviridae and unclassified oomycete-infecting viruses. The name Cruciviridae has been proposed for this group.       The families Bidnaviridae and Parvoviridae have linear genomes while the other families have circular genomes. The Bidnaviridae have a two part genome and infect invertebrates. The Inoviridae and Microviridae infect bacteria ; the Anelloviridae and Circoviridae infect animal s ; and the Geminiviridae and Nanoviridae infect plant s. In both the Geminiviridae and Nanoviridae the genome is composed of more than a single chromosome. The Bacillariodnaviridae infect diatom s and have a unique genome: the major chromosome is circular : the minor chromosome is linear and complementary to part of the major chromosome. Members of the Spiraviridae infect archaea. Members of the Genomoviridae infect fungi.       All viruses in this group require formation of a replicative form—a double stranded DNA intermediate—for genome replication. This is normally created from the viral DNA with the assistance of the hosts own DNA polymerase .

These viruses appear to be related to three viruses previously isolated from waste water, a bat and from a rodent.   This appears to belong to a novel group.

This virus has a circular ssDNA genome and an internal lipid membrane enclosed in an icosahedral capsid. The capsid organisation is he capsid organization pseudo T 21 dextro. The major capsid protein has two β-barrels. The capsid organisation is similar to bacteriophage PM2—a double stranded bacterial virus.       Satellite virus es are small viruses with either RNA or DNA as their genomic material that require another virus to replicate. There are two types of DNA satellite viruses—the alphasatellite s and the betasatellite s—both of which are dependent on begomovirus es. At present satellite viruses are not classified into genera or higher taxa.     Alphasatellites are small circular single strand DNA viruses that require a begomovirus for transmission. Betasatellites are small linear single stranded DNA viruses that require a begomovirus to replicate.           Phylogenetic relationships between these families are difficult to determine. The genomes differ significantly in size and organisation. Most studies that have attempted to determine these relationships are based either on some of the more conserved proteins—DNA polymerase and others—or on common structural features. In general most of the proposed relationships are tentative and have not yet been used by the ICTV in their classification.         While determining the phylogenetic relations between the various known clades of viruses is difficult, on a number of grounds the herpesviruses and caudoviruses appear to be related.     While the three families in the order Herpesvirales are clearly related on morphological grounds, it has proven difficult to determine the dates of divergence between them because of the lack of gene conservation. On morphological grounds they appear to be related to the bacteriophages—specifically the Caudoviruses.     The branching order among the herpesviruses suggests that Alloherpesviridae is the basal clade and that Herpesviridae and Malacoherpesviridae are sister clades. Given the phylogenetic distances between vertebrates and molluscs this suggests that herpesviruses were initially fish viruses and that they have evolved with their hosts to infect other vertebrates.     The vertebrate herpesviruses initially evolved ~ and underwent subsequent evolution on the supercontinent Pangaea . The alphaherpesvirinae separated from the branch leading to the betaherpesvirinae and gammaherpesvirinae about to . The avian herpes viruses diverged from the branch leading to the mammalian species. The mammalian species divided into two branches—the Simplexvirus and Varicellovirus genera. This latter divergence appears to have occurred around the time of the mammalian radiation.     Several dsDNA bacteriophages and the herpesviruses encode a powerful ATP driven DNA translocating machine that encapsidates a viral genome into a preformed capsid shell or prohead. The critical components of the packaging machine are the packaging enzyme which acts as the motor and the portal protein that forms the unique DNA entrance vertex of prohead. The terminase complex consists of a recognition subunit and an endonuclease/translocase subunit and cuts viral genome concatemers. It forms a motor complex containing five large terminase subunits. The terminase-viral DNA complex docks on the portal vertex. The pentameric motor processively translocates DNA until the head shell is full with one viral genome. The motor cuts the DNA again and dissociates from the full head, allowing head-finishing proteins to assemble on the portal, sealing the portal, and constructing a platform for tail attachment. Only a single gene encoding the putative ATPase subunit of the terminase  is conserved among all herpesviruses. To a lesser extent this gene is also found in T4-like bacteriophages suggesting a common ancestor for these two groups of viruses. Another paper has also suggested that herpesviruses originated among the bacteriophages.     A common origin for the herpesviruses and the caudoviruses has been suggested on the basis of parallels in their capsid assembly pathways and similarities between their portal complexes, through which DNA enters the capsid. These two groups of viruses share a distinctive 12-fold arrangement of subunits in the portal complex. A second paper has suggested an evolutionary relationship between these two groups of viruses.     It seems likely that the tailed viruses infecting the archaea are also related to the tailed viruses infecting bacteria.     A study involving 600 herpes genomes and 2000 caudoviral genomes suggested that an evolutionary relationship exists between these order. Andrade-Martínez JS, Moreno-Gallego JL, Reyes A Defining a core genome for the Herpesvirales and exploring their evolutionary relationship with the Caudovirales. Sci Rep 9:11342       The nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus group  along with three other families—Adenoviridae, Cortiviridae and Tectiviridae— and the phage Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus and the satellite virus Sputnik all possess double β-barrel major capsid proteins suggesting a common origin.     Several studies have suggested that the family Ascoviridae evolved from the Iridoviridae. A study of the Iridoviruses suggests that the Iridoviridae, Ascoviridae and Marseilleviridae are related with Ascoviruses most closely related to Iridoviruses.     The family Polydnaviridae may have evolved from the Ascoviridae. Molecular evidence suggests that the Phycodnaviridae may have evolved from the family Iridoviridae. These four families  may form a clade but more work is needed to confirm this.     Some of the relations among the large viruses have been established. Mimiviruses are distantly related to Phycodnaviridae. Pandoraviruses share a common ancestor with Coccolithoviruses within the family Phycodnaviridae. Pithoviruses are related to Iridoviridae and Marseilleviridae.     Based on the genome organisation and DNA replication mechanism it seems that phylogenetic relationships may exist between the rudiviruses  and the large eukaryal DNA viruses: the African swine fever virus , Chlorella viruses  and poxviruses .     Based on the analysis of the DNA polymerase the genus Dinodnavirus may be a member of the family Asfarviridae. Further work on this virus will required before a final assignment can be made.     It has been suggested that at least some of the giant viruses may originate from mitochondria.       Based on the analysis of the coat protein, Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus may share a common ancestry with the Tectiviridae.     The families Adenoviridae and Tectiviridae appear to be related structurally.     Baculoviruses evolved from the nudiviruses .     The Hytrosaviridae are related to the baculoviruses and to a lesser extent the nudiviruses suggesting they may have evolved from the baculoviruses.     The Nimaviridae may be related to nudiviruses and baculoviruses.     The Nudiviruses seem to be related to the polydnaviruses.     A protein common to the families Bicaudaviridae, Lipotrixviridae and Rudiviridae and the unclassified virus Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus is known suggesting a common origin.     Examination of the pol genes that encode the DNA dependent DNA polymerase in various groups of viruses suggests a number of possible evolutionary relationships. All know viral DNA polymerases belong to the DNA pol families A and B. All possess a 3-5- exonuclease domain with three sequence motifs Exo I, Exo II and Exo III. The families A and B are distinguishable with family A Pol sharing 9 distinct consensus sequences and only two of them are convincingly homologous to sequence motif B of family B. The putative sequence motifs A, B, and C of the polymerase domain are located near the C-terminus in family A Pol and more central in family B Pol.     Phylogenetic analysis of these genes places the adenoviruses , bacteriophages  and the plant and fungal linear plasmids into a single clade. A second clade includes the alpha- and delta-like viral Pol from insect ascovirus , mammalian herpesviruses , fish lymphocystis disease virus  and chlorella virus . The pol genes of the African swine fever virus , baculoviruses , fish herpesvirus , T-even bacteriophages  and poxviruses  were not clearly resolved. A second study showed that poxvirus, baculovirus and the animal herpesviruses form separate and distinct clades. Their relationship to the Asfarviridae and the Myoviridae was not examined and remains unclear.     The polymerases from the archaea are similar to family B DNA Pols. The T4-like viruses infect both bacteria and archaea and their pol gene resembles that of eukaryote s. The DNA polymerase of mitochondria resembles that of the T odd phages .     The virophage— Mavirus —may have evolved from a recombination between a transposon of the Polinton family and an unknown virus.     The polyoma and papillomaviruses appear to have evolved from single-stranded DNA viruses and ultimately from plasmids.       The evolutionary history of this group is currently poorly understood. An ancient origin for the single stranded circular DNA viruses has been proposed.     Capsid proteins of most icosahedral ssRNA and ssDNA viruses display the same structural fold, the eight-stranded beta-barrel, also known as the jelly-roll fold . On the other hand, the replication proteins of icosahedral ssDNA viruses belong to the superfamily of rolling-circle replication initiation proteins that are commonly found in prokaryotic plasmids. Based on these observations, it has been proposed that small DNA viruses have originated via recombination between RNA viruses and plasmids.     Circoviruses may have evolved from a nanovirus.     Given the similarities between the rep proteins of the alphasatellites and the nanoviruses, it is likely that the alphasatellites evolved from the nanoviruses. Further work in this area is needed to clarify this.     The geminiviruses may have evolved from phytoplasmal plasmids.  The Genomoviridae and the Geminividiae appear to be related.     Based on the three-dimensional structure of the Rep proteins the geminiviruses and parvoviruses may be related.     The ancestor of the geminiviruses probably infected dicots.      The ": null
