        " : Austrian Late-Romantic composer and conductor It is particularly poor salesmanship for Ms. Raabe to cite Mahlers supposed conversion from Judaism to Catholicism. In both law and common understanding, a choice made under duress is discounted as lacking in free will. Mahler converted as a mere formality under compulsion of a bigoted law that barred Jews from directorship of the Vienna Hofoper. Mahler himself joked about the conversion with his Jewish friends, and, no doubt, would view with bitter amusement the obtuseness of Ms. Raabes understanding of the cruel choice forced on him: either convert to Christianity or forfeit the professional post for which you are supremely destined. When Mahler was asked why he never composed a Mass, he answered bluntly that he could never, with any degree of artistic or spiritual integrity, voice the Credo. He was a confirmed agnostic, a doubter and seeker, never a soul at rest or at peace. Joel Martel, , New York Times.   He was born a Jew but has been described as a life-long agnostic. At one point he converted to Catholicism, purely for the purpose of obtaining a job that he coveted – director of the Court Opera of Vienna. It was unthinkable for a Jew to hold such a prestigious position, hence the utilitarian conversion to the state religion. Warren Allen Smith, Celebrities in Hell, pp. 76–77.      ": null

His quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography . Humboldt, by contrast, was an agnostic in religious sentiment and a Heraclitean in his cosmology; he regarded change, and species mutability, as being as natural as changing wind patterns or ocean currents. Harry Francis Mallgrave, Gottfried Semper: Architect of the Nineteenth Century , page 157.   Andrew Huxley : English physiologist and biophysicist. He won the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his experimental and mathematical work on the basis of nerve action potentials, the electrical impulses that enable the activity of an organism to be coordinated by a central nervous system.   Thomas Henry Huxley : English biologist and coiner of the term agnosticism. Every variety of philosophical and theological opinion was represented there, and expressed itself with entire openness; most of my colleagues were ists of one sort or another; and, however kind and friendly they might be, I, the man without a rag of a label to cover himself with, could not fail to have some of the uneasy feelings which must have beset the historical fox when, after leaving the trap in which his tail remained, he presented himself to his normally elongated companions. So I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of agnostic. http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/thomas_huxley/huxley_wace/part_02.html Part 2 – Agnosticism, by T.

Though research activities dominated his working days, Faraday never neglected to meet with his Christian friends for worship and prayer. We quote again from John Tyndall who, it should be said, was an agnostic: I think that a good deal of Faradays week-day strength and persistency might be referred to his Sunday Exercises. He drinks from a fount on Sunday which refreshes his soul for a week. The Biblical Creation Society,  , 2002. The odd subtext of that offer was that Faraday was intensely religious, and Tyndall was as fascinated with Faradays convictions as he was with prayer, miracles, and cosmology. Faraday drinks from a fount on Sunday which refreshes his soul for a week, said the agnostic Tyndall with obvious fascination – and, perhaps, a trace of envy. John H.
