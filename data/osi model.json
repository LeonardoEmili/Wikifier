Within each layer, one or more entities implement its functionality. Each entity interacted directly only with the layer immediately beneath it, and provided facilities for use by the layer above it.     The OSI standards documents are available from the ITU-T as the X.200-series of recommendations.    Some of the protocol specifications were also available as part of the ITU-T X series. The equivalent ISO and ISO/IEC standards for the OSI model were available from ISO. Not all are free of charge.      OSI was hence an industry effort, attempting to get industry participants to agree on common network standards to provide multi-vendor interoperability.
