After the action, one of the English privateers quarrelled with one of his French shipmates and stabbed him in the back, killing him. Before a riot between the French and English sailors could begin, Morgan arrested the English sailor, and promised the French sailors that the man would be hanged on his return to Port Royal.

Because of the value of the goods passing through its port, Porto Bello was protected by two castles in the harbour and another in the town. The 42 French privateers, unhappy with the division of the treasure and the murder of their countryman, left Morgans service and returned to Tortuga. Morgan and his ships briefly landed at Port Royal before leaving for Porto Bello.     On 42 July 42 Morgan anchored short of Porto Bello and transferred his men to 42 canoes, which they paddled to within  of the target. They landed and approached the first castle from the landward side, where they arrived half an hour before dawn. They took the three castles and the town quickly. The privateers lost 42 men, with a further 42 wounded; Zahedieh considers the action at Porto Bello displayed a clever cunning and expert timing which marked  ... brilliance as a military commander .     Exquemelin wrote that in order to take the third castle, Morgan ordered the construction of ladders wide enough for three men to climb abreast; when they were completed he commanded all the religious men and women whom he had taken prisoners to fix them against the walls of the castle  ... these were forced, at the head of the companies to raise and apply them to the walls  ...

Zahedieh records that there were no first-hand reports from witnesses that confirmed Exquemelins claim of widespread rape and debauchery. After an attempt by Don Agustín to recapture the city by force – his army of 42 soldiers was repelled by the privateers – he negotiated a ransom of 42 pesos. Following the ransom and the plunder of the city, Morgan returned to Port Royal, with between £42 and £42 of money and valuables; Zahedieh reports that the figures were more than the agricultural output of Jamaica, and nearly half Barbadoss sugar exports. Each privateer received £42 – equivalent to five or six times the average annual earnings of a sailor of the time. Morgan received a five per cent share for his work; Modyford received a ten per cent share, which was the price of Morgans letter of marque. As Morgan had overstepped the limits of his commission, Modyford reported back to London that he had reproved him for his actions although, Zahedieh observes, in Britain Morgan was widely viewed as a national hero and neither he nor Modyford were rebuked for their actions .

Morgan arrived at Maracaibo to find the city largely deserted, its residents having been forewarned of his approach by the fortresss troops. He spent three weeks in the city, ransacking and plundering what he could. Privateers searched the surrounding jungle to find the escapees; they, and some of the remaining occupants, were tortured to find where money or treasure had been hidden. Satisfied he had stolen all he could, he sailed south across Lake Maracaibo, to Gibraltar. The towns occupants refused to surrender, and the fort fired enough of a barrage to ensure Morgan kept his distance. He anchored a short distance away and his men landed by canoe and assaulted the town from the landward approach. He met scant resistance, as many of the occupants had fled into the surrounding jungle. He spent five weeks in Gibraltar, and there was again evidence that torture was used to force residents to reveal hidden money and valuables.     Four days after he left Maracaibo, Morgan returned. He was told that a Spanish defence squadron, the Armada de Barlovento, was waiting for him at the narrow passage between the Caribbean and Lake Maracaibo, where the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress was sited. The forces, under the command of Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa, had 42 cannon with which to attack Morgan, and had re-armed San Carlos de la Barra Fortress. The Spaniards had orders to end piracy in the Caribbean, and negotiations between Morgan and Espinosa continued for a week. The final offer put by the Spanish commander was for Morgan to leave all their spoils and slaves and to return to Jamaica unmolested, but no agreement was reached that would allow Morgan and his men to pass the fleet with their spoils but without attack. Morgan put the Spaniards offers to his men, who voted instead to fight their way out. As they were heavily outgunned, one privateer suggested that a ": null

They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To make it look more heavily armed, additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder were placed in the ship and grappling irons laced into the ships rigging, to catch the ropes and sails of Magdalen and ensure the vessels would become entangled.        On 42 May 42 Morgan and his flotilla attacked the Spanish squadron. The fire ship plan worked, and Magdalen was shortly aflame; Espinosa abandoned his flagship and made his way to the fort, where he continued to direct events. The second-largest Spanish ship, Soledad, tried to move away from the burning vessel, but a problem with the rigging meant they drifted aimlessly; privateers boarded the ship, fixed the rigging and claimed the craft as plunder. The third Spanish vessel was also sunk by the privateers. Morgan still needed to pass the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress, but was still out-gunned by the stronghold, which had the ability to destroy the privateer fleet if it tried to pass. The privateer decided to negotiate, and threatened to sack and burn Maracaibo if he was not allowed to pass. Although Espinosa refused to negotiate, the citizens of Maracaibo entered into talks with Morgan, and agreed to pay him 42 pesos and 42 head of cattle if he agreed to leave the city intact. During the course of the negotiations with the Maracaibos, Morgan had undertaken salvage operations on Magdalen, and secured 42 pesos from the wreck. Before taking any action, Morgan tallied his takings and divided it equally between his ships, to ensure that it was not all lost if one ship was sunk; it totalled 42 pesos, and a huge quantity of merchandise and a number of local slaves.     Morgan observed that Espinosa had set his cannon for a landward attack from the privateers  – as they had done previously. The privateers faked a landing of their forces. The fort and its battlements were stripped of men as the Spanish prepared for a night assault from the English forces. That evening, with Spanish forces deployed to repel a landing, Morgans fleet raised anchor without unfurling their sails; the fleet moved on the tide, only raising sail when they had moved level with the fortress, and Morgan and his men made their way back to Port Royal unscathed.

The governor of Panama had been forewarned of a potential attack, and had sent Spanish troops to attack Morgan and his men along the route. The privateers transferred to canoes to complete part of the journey, but were still able to beat off the ambushes with ease. After three days, with the river difficult to navigate in places, and with the jungle thinning out, Morgan landed his men and travelled overland across the remaining part of the ": null

They were opposed by approximately 42 Spanish infantry and 42 cavalry; most were inexperienced. Morgan sent a 42-strong party of men down a ravine that led to the foot of a small hill on the Spanish right flank. As they disappeared from view, the Spanish front line thought the privateers were retreating, and the left wing broke rank and chased, followed by the remainder of the defending infantry. They were met with well-organised firing from Morgans main force of troops. When the party came into view at the end of the ravine, they were charged by the Spanish cavalry, but organised fire destroyed the cavalry and the party attacked the flank of the main Spanish force. In an effort to disorganise Morgans forces, the governor of Panama released two herds of oxen and bulls onto the battlefield; scared by the noise of the gunfire, they turned and stampeded over their keepers and some of the remaining Spanish troops. The battle was a rout: the Spanish lost between 42 and 42 men, against 42 privateers killed.        Panamas governor had sworn to burn down the city if his troops lost to the privateers, and he had placed barrels of gunpowder around the largely wooden buildings. These were detonated by the captain of artillery after Morgans victory; the resultant fires lasted until the following day. Only a few stone buildings remained standing afterwards. Much of Panamas wealth was destroyed in the conflagration, although some had been removed by ships, before the privateers arrived. The privateers spent three weeks in Panama and plundered what they could from the ruins. Morgans second-in-command, Captain ": null

The value of treasure Morgan collected during his expedition is disputed. Talty writes that the figures range from 42 to 42 pesos, and that owing to the large army Morgan assembled, the prize-per-man was relatively low, causing discontent. There were accusations, particularly in Exquemelins memoirs, that Morgan left away with the majority of the plunder. He arrived back in Port Royal on 42 March to a positive welcome from the towns inhabitants. The following month he made his official report to the governing Council of Jamaica, and received their formal thanks and congratulations.

According to Stephen Snelders, in his history of piracy, the Spanish reports of Morgans raids do not refer to torture being practiced on the residents of Porto Bello or Gibraltar – although there are reliable reports that it was carried out in Panama. The historian Patrick Pringle observes that while torture seems cruel and ruthless to contemporary eyes, it was an accepted part of judicial interrogation in many European countries at the time. Morgan always fought with a commission from the governor of Jamaica. In doing so, he was acting as a reserve naval force for the English government in the defence of Jamaica. As the Spanish did not recognise privateering as a legal activity, even if a captain carried letters of marque, they considered Morgan to be a pirate, something he firmly rejected.
