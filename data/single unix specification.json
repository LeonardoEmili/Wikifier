The need for standardization arose because enterprises using computers wanted to be able to develop programs that could be used on the computer systems of different manufacturers without reimplementing the programs. Unix was selected as the basis for a standard system interface partly because it was manufacturer-neutral.       In 1988, these standards became IEEE 1003 , or  POSIX , which loosely stands for Portable Operating System Interface.
