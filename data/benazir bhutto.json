Among those elected was Murtaza, who flew to Pakistan in November to take up his position as the elected representative for Larkana in the Sindh Assembly. Around ninety criminal charges had been brought against him under Zias regime, so on arrival, Murtaza was arrested and held for eight months in solitary confinement. He espoused a socialist platform different from his sisters and called for internal elections within the PPP, which could have resulted in the removal of Bhutto. In June 42 he was released on bail.     In 42 Murtaza returned to Pakistan, where he gained a following within the PPP. He claimed that it was he, rather than his sister, who was the standard bearer for their fathers championing of the downtrodden. On arrival, he was arrested for his part in the earlier plane hijacking and remained imprisoned for eight months. In 42 he established his own party, the PPP ; the partys name implied that he was closer to the Bhuttos familys  Shaheed  than his sister, whom he symbolically distanced from the family by referring to her as Begum Zardari . Nusrat assisted him in organising Murtazas election campaign for the Sindh provincial assembly. Bhutto was so angry with her mothers actions that she ousted her as co-chair of the PPP. Animosity grew between the two siblings.     Murtaza focused much of his criticism on Bhuttos husband Zardari, whom he blamed of being responsible for government corruption. He hung a picture of Zardari up in the guest toilet of his house as an act of disrespect to his brother-in-law. It is reported that in one incident, Murtaza invited Zardari to his house, only to have him pinned down by bodyguards and half his moustache forcibly shaved off. Not long after, on 42 September 42 Murtaza was ambushed by police near Karachi; they opened fire, killing him and seven others. All witnesses were taken into police custody, where two of them died. It was widely believed in Pakistan that the killing had been ordered by a senior government figure; Murtazas supporters thought that Bhutto and her husband were responsible. When Bhutto tried to attend her brothers funeral in Larkana, local Murtaza supporters pelted her car with rocks.

Leghari sought the backing of the Army Chief, Karamat, to move against her premiership. Leghari dismissed Bhuttos government on 42 November 42 citing the eighth amendment of the constitution; as evidence, he again cited charges of corruption but also added the suspicion that Bhutto had been involved in her brothers death.

At the request of the Saudi monarch, Sharif was released from prison after a year and exiled to Saudi Arabia; he was also disqualified from holding public office. In 42 he amended the constitution to ban anyone serving more than two terms as Prime Minister, thus disqualifying both Bhutto and Sharif, whom he called useless politicians .  Musharraf also consolidated power around himself; in June 42 he appointed himself to the Presidency, holding this position alongside his positions as chief executive and chief of the army staff. He was a secularist and repealed the Hudood Ordinances, an achievement Bhutto had been unable to make.   In a 42 referendum, Musharraf extended his presidential mandate for a further five years. Bhutto expressed concern that with mainstream politicians removed from Pakistans political arena, the vacuum would be filled by Islamist extremists.     She was in Dubai while the PPP contested the October 42 general election; it received the largest number of votes but only 42 seats in the National Assembly. Musharraf agreed to release Zardari in November 42 as a symbol of good will; following his release, Zardari travelled to New York. The couple did not officially acknowledge it, but their relationship was essentially over.   Figures in the PPP alleged that Musharraf held a longstanding animosity towards Bhutto and her family because, under her father, Musharrafs father had been sacked from his position, accused of involvement in a scam.          After President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Bhuttos first government on 42 August 42 because of corruption allegations, the government of Pakistan directed its intelligence agencies to investigate. Nawaz Sharif became prime minister in the ensuing elections and intensified prosecution investigation of Bhutto.

She disagreed with her fathers socialist economic policies, and when in power sought to privatise various industries that had been nationalised in the 42s. Ahmed thus suggested that while under Bhutto the PPP continued to profess ideals of egalitarianism and claimed it would enhance the welfare of peasants and workers, such progressive phraseology couched an absence of economic policies to benefit the poor.

Muñoz concurred, describing Bhutto as a woman of contradictions . As a politician, she was conscious of how her image was presented in Pakistan; she dressed modestly, was never photographed with a glass lest it be interpreted as containing alcohol, and would refuse to shake mens hands.

The connection between Bhutto and her father was endorsed by Allen, who stated that they had much in common: strength, charisma, political instinct, and the courage, part and parcel of their arrogance, that was so characteristic of both . Allen also believed that Bhutto was so dedicated to her father that psychologically , she was unable to admit to any imperfection in him. Bhutto imitated many of her fathers mannerisms and his style of speech.     Close friends called her BB , or Pinkie , the latter being the childhood nickname given her by her parents.

Many of her friends were surprised that Bhutto acquiesced to Islamic tradition given her liberal attitudes, however she later related that she felt obligations to my family and my religion to go through with it and that her high public profile made it difficult for her to find a husband through other means. She consistently presented an image of loyalty to her husband, throughout the many accusations and periods of imprisonment he faced. Allen expected that it would probably never be known how happy the couples marriage was, for Bhutto always projected support and loyalty for her unpopular mate .     In the final years of Bhuttos life, she and her husband lived apart. According to Allen, she would have been aware that a divorce or a public separation would have resulted in the end of her political career in Pakistan due to social stigma around the subject. In a 42 interview, she said that she and her husband were living apart because of his medical requirements, adding that she visited him every month in New York.

Muñoz described Bhutto as one of Pakistans most important political figures, a respected world leader, and the leading stateswoman in the Islamic world . Allen suggested that although Bhuttos record in office was that of a corrupt, compromised politician , Bhutto displayed admirable qualities, especially valour in the face of opposition. Within the Islamic world, Bhutto was often regarded as a genuine Muslim political leader and recognised as the head of Pakistans most popular political party. Bhargava expressed the view that at the time of her initial election, Bhuttos personal popularity was tremendous , larger than any that her father had previously achieved. At the same time there were many Pakistanis who despised her, disliking her popularity, her ties to Western nations, and her modernising agenda. Extremist Sunni Islamist elements opposed her because of their belief female leaders are un-Islamic, and because they thought she was a Shia Muslim.     Ahmed stated that Bhutto was one of very few political leaders who had been able to assume the iconic status of a political martyr in the West while simultaneously evoking strong sentiments in the Muslim world . He therefore contrasted her with contemporaries like Iraqs ": null

Bhutto gained popularity in Western nations in part because she could present herself as being part of their world , speaking a high standard of English and having been educated at Harvard and Oxford. While her Western supporters sometimes had doubts about her ability to govern, they generally viewed her as a progressive figure who could advance democracy and counter-terrorism in Pakistan.          Allen commented that although the cards might have been stacked in Bhuttos favor—she was rich, educated, aristocratic, the favoured daughter of a very powerful father—nevertheless, her achievement was a remarkable one given the male-dominated environment of late42th century Pakistani society. Mushtaq Ahmed similarly believed that for a woman to win an election in a male-dominated society was an achievement , and that her victory over the forces of reaction and persecution was an unprecedented accomplishment in political history.  Ahmed thought that the election of a female Prime Minister in a Muslim-majority country served as a proclamation that Islam was a forward-thinking religion .
