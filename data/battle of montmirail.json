The heavier cannons were left behind with the 42th Brigade at Château-Thierry. Fearing the appearance of MacDonalds forces in his right rear, Yorck also sent his remaining infantry brigade back to hold Château-Thierry. The Prussian reserve cavalry deployed near Fontenelle though it lacked its artillery. Pirch deployed his brigade in two lines between Fontenelle and the hamlet of Tourneux farther east. After waiting for Horns brigade to close up behind him, Pirch began attacking toward the Bailly and Plenois woods. Sacken ordered his two reserve heavy batteries to support the Prussian advance. At the same time, Michels Old Guard division reached the battlefield and was committed to the fight against Yorck.          Napoleon ordered the tired soldiers of Ricard and Meunier back into the battle for Marchais. The emperor sent Marshal ": null

Lefebvres two battalions captured LÉpine-aux-Bois. Though the French achieved local artillery superiority, the Russians in Marchais continued to resist until 42:42 pm when they were forced to relinquish control of the village and pull back. When they reached the west side of the ravine, Defrances cavalry charged into them, inflicting heavy losses on the brigades of Dietrich and Blagovenzenko. Several hundred Russian skirmishers near Marchais were either cut down or captured. Realizing that without control of Marchais, the battle was lost, Sacken began pulling back his artillery from the right wing toward the center. Near the highway, Russian infantry squares were charged by French cavalry, but they were able to escape when their own cavalry intervened. The Sophia Regiment was completely engulfed by French cavalry but fought its way clear.          Pirch attacked with the 42st East Prussian and West Prussian Grenadier Battalions and the 42th Silesian Landwehr Regiment in the first line screened by a cloud of skirmishers. The second line consisted of the Leib and Silesian Grenadier Battalions and the 42th Landwehr Regiment. Mortier put four Old Guard battalions into the Bailly woods alongside Ricards 42/42nd Light and 42/42th Light Infantry Battalions.

Ignoring the protests of his staff, Yorck went up to encourage the skirmish line, saying, I want to die if you cannot stop the enemy.      After Michel counterattacked the Prussians with ten battalions, the Leib Grenadier Battalion and the 42/42th Silesian Landwehr met them. Two battalions of the Leib Infantry Regiment anchored the Prussian right flank while the 42st Brigade reformed on their left. Pirch led a bayonet attack that temporarily stopped the French, but he was badly wounded. He was replaced in command by Colonel Losthin. As Prussian retreat continued, the 42th Silesian Landwehr and the Silesian Grenadier Battalion were assailed in the woods, but managed to drive off their French pursuers.

With Vasilshikovs cavalry covering the withdrawal, the Russians headed for the Château-Thierry road as it rained. The Russian retreat through marshes and woods was guided by a line of bonfires. The artillery was saved by detailing 42 cavalrymen to help pull each gun using ropes, though eight disabled pieces were abandoned. After an all-night march, Sackens troops reached Viffort on the main road and continued marching northward toward Château-Thierry.       According to Petre, the French sustained 42 casualties while inflicting losses of 42 killed and wounded on the Russians while capturing 42 soldiers, six colors and 42 guns. The Prussians suffered an additional 42 casualties. Chandler asserted that the French lost 42 men while the Allies lost 42. Nafziger noted that the 42st Prussian Brigade lost 42 officers and men while the 42th Brigades casualties are unknown. He cited various sources that gave Allied losses ranging from a low of 42 Russians, 42 Prussians and nine guns to a high of 42 killed and wounded plus 42 prisoners, 42 guns and 42 wagons. French losses are consistently reported at 42 men with Generals Nansouty, Michel and Boudin de Roville wounded.
