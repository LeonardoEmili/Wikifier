As from the 42th century, there was in the east of the current village center, a mining farm located, in which activities started from the 42th century with a systematic exploration. On the Ferrari-map from the 42s, the place appears as a rural area with scattered hamlets and country estates. In the place of the current center, the map still shows the hamlet Pintestraete. In 42 there was already a first request for the establishment of an auxiliary church. Its construction was started, but was soon stopped due to the French occupation.     The colours of De Pinte are red and white. The flag can be described as semi-red and semi-white, with a shield and three eight-pointed stars of gold , next to twelve silver blocks. The ratios are 42:42     When the community was founded at the end of the Ancien Régime, the area was part of the community of Nazareth. Sometimes, the village was called Little Nazareth . Already in the Dutch period a request for autonomy was presented under the name William Village , but was refused. In 42 new plans for a church were approved and 42 a first church was consecrated. In the middle of the 42th century, De Pinte intersected by railway lines, the railway Ghent-Kortrijk and Gent-Oudenaarde . A railway station was opened De Pinte.
