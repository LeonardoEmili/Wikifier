However, according to Julia Ruth Stevens recount in 1999, because George Sr. was a saloon owner in Baltimore and had given Ruth little supervision growing up, he became a delinquent. Ruth was sent to St. Marys because George Sr. ran out of ideas to discipline and mentor his son.  As an adult, Ruth admitted that as a youth he had been running the streets and rarely attending school, as well was drinking beer when his father was not looking. Some accounts say that following a violent incident at his fathers saloon, the city authorities decided that this environment was unsuitable for a small child. Ruth entered St. Marys on June 13, 1902. He was recorded as incorrigible and spent much of the next 12 years there.           Although St. Marys boys received an education, students were also expected to learn work skills and help operate the school, particularly once the boys turned 12. Ruth became a shirtmaker and was also proficient as a carpenter. He would adjust his own shirt collars, rather than having a tailor do so, even during his well-paid baseball career. The boys, aged 5 to 21, did most of the work around the facility, from cooking to shoemaking, and renovated St. Marys in 1912. The food was simple, and the ": null

He was rarely visited by his family; his mother died when he was 12 and, by some accounts, he was permitted to leave St. Marys only to attend the funeral.

Nevertheless, his biographer Leigh Montville suggests that many of the off-the-field excesses of Ruths career were driven by the deprivations of his time at St. Marys.      Most of the boys at St. Marys played baseball in organized leagues at different levels of proficiency.

When Ruth insisted on taking batting practice despite being both a rookie who did not play regularly, and a pitcher, he arrived to find his bats sawn in half.

During the 1919 season, Ruth was used as a pitcher in only 17 of his 130 games and compiled an 8–5 record. Barrow used him as a pitcher mostly in the early part of the season, when the Red Sox manager still had hopes of a second consecutive pennant.

Still, the story may be true in essence: No, No, Nanette was based on a Frazee-produced play, My Lady Friends, which opened in 1919.      There were other financial pressures on Frazee, despite his teams success. Ruth, fully aware of baseballs popularity and his role in it, wanted to renegotiate his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per year through 1921. He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he would sit out the season and cash in on his popularity through other ventures.  Ruths salary demands were causing other players to ask for more money. Stout, p. 83 Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from the purchase of the club.      Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel ": null

Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase.      Frazee sold the rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a baseball player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner that he was getting the worse end of the bargain.   Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee.  The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.     The transaction was contingent on Ruth signing a new contract, which was quickly accomplished—Ruth agreed to fulfill the remaining two years on his contract, but was given a $20,000 bonus, payable over two seasons. The deal was announced on January 6, 1920. Reaction in Boston was mixed: some fans were embittered at the loss of Ruth; others conceded that Ruth had become difficult to deal with. Stout, pp. 86–88 The New York Times suggested that The short right field wall at the Polo Grounds should prove an easy target for Ruth next season and, playing seventy-seven games at home, it would not be surprising if Ruth surpassed his home run record of twenty-nine circuit clouts next Summer.  According to Reisler, The Yankees had pulled off the sports steal of the century.     According to Marty Appel in his history of the Yankees, the transaction, changed the fortunes of two high-profile franchises for decades .

They won seven AL pennants and four World Series with Ruth, and led baseball with 40 pennants and 27 World Series titles in their history.             When Ruth signed with the Yankees, he completed his transition from a pitcher to a power-hitting outfielder. His fifteen-season Yankee career consisted of over 2,000 games, and Ruth broke many batting records while making only five widely scattered appearances on the mound, winning all of them.     At the end of April 1920, the Yankees were 4–7, with the Red Sox leading the league with a 10–2 mark. Ruth had done little, having injured himself swinging the bat.

While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so poor that he could barely trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well.

Sometime in 1932, during a conversation that she assumed was private, Gehrigs mother remarked, Its a shame doesnt dress Dorothy as nicely as she dresses her own daughter. When the comment inevitably got back to Ruth, he angrily told Gehrig to tell his mother to mind her own business. Gehrig, in turn, took offense at what he perceived as Ruths comment about his mother. The two men reportedly never spoke off the field until they reconciled at Yankee Stadium on Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day, July 4, 1939, which was shortly after Gehrigs retirement from baseball.

Ruth was the first baseball star to be the subject of overwhelming public adulation. Baseball had been known for star players such as Ty Cobb and Shoeless Joe Jackson, but both men had uneasy relations with fans. In Cobbs case, the incidents were sometimes marked by violence.

Montville argued that Ruth was a larger-than-life figure who was capable of unprecedented athletic feats in the nations largest city. Ruth became an icon of the social changes that marked the early 1920s.   In his history of the Yankees, Glenn Stout writes that Ruth was New York incarnate—uncouth and raw, flamboyant and flashy, oversized, out of scale, and absolutely unstoppable . Stout, p. 86     During his lifetime, Ruth had become a symbol of the United States. During World War II, Japanese soldiers could think of no greater insult than to yell in English, To hell with Babe Ruth , to anger American soldiers. Ruth replied that he hoped every Jap that mention my name gets shot .  Creamer recorded that Babe Ruth transcended sport and moved far beyond the artificial limits of baselines and outfield fences and sports pages .  Wagenheim stated, He appealed to a deeply rooted American yearning for the definitive climax: clean, quick, unarguable.  According to Glenn Stout, Ruths home runs were exalted, uplifting experience that meant more to fans than any runs they were responsible for. A Babe Ruth home run was an event unto itself, one that meant anything was possible.     Ruths penchant for hitting home runs altered how baseball is played. Prior to 1920, home runs were unusual, and managers tried to win games by getting a runner on base and bringing him around to score through such means as the stolen base, the ": null

Phelon, after the 1920 season, Ruths breakout performance that season and the response in excitement and attendance, settled, for all time to come, that the American public is nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching. Viva el Home Run and two times viva Babe Ruth, exponent of the home run, and overshadowing star.  Bill James states, When the owners discovered that the fans liked to see home runs, and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace then there was no turning back.  While a few, such as McGraw and Cobb, decried the passing of the old-style play, teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers.      According to contemporary sportswriter ": null

Montville writes that the fog will make him forever accessible, universal. He will be the patron saint of American possibility.  Similarly, the fact that Ruth played in the pre-television era, when a relatively small portion of his fans had the opportunity to see him play allowed his legend to grow through word of mouth and the hyperbole of sports reporters.

Similarly, Ruthian has come to mean in sports, colossal, dramatic, prodigious, magnificent; with great power.      In 2006, Montville stated that more books have been written about Ruth than any other member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. At least five of these books were written in 1973 and 1974.
