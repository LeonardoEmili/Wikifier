The velocity of a body is easily changeable, but in most cases the mass is not, which makes it important.       In rockets, the total velocity change can be calculated  as follows:     \\Delta\\,v u\\,\\ln\\left     Where:   v ship velocity.   u exhaust velocity.

This is not the case for most rockets however, where the rocket propellant is the working mass, as well as the energy source. This means that rockets stop accelerating as soon as they run out of fuel, regardless of other power sources they may have. This can be a problem for satellites that need to be repositioned often, as it limits their useful life. In general, the exhaust velocity should be close to the ship velocity for optimum energy efficiency.
