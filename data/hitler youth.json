The aim was to instill the motivation that would enable its members to fight faithfully for Nazi Germany as soldiers. There was greater emphasis on physical fitness, hardness and military training than on academic study. Sacrifice for the cause was inculcated into their training. Former Hitler Youth, Franz Jagemann claimed for instance that the notion Germany must live even if they had to die was hammered into them.          The Hitler Youth were used to break up Church youth groups, and in anti-Church indoctrination, used to spy on religious classes and Bible studies, and interfere with church attendance. Education and training programs for the Hitler Youth were designed to undermine the values of the traditional elitist structures of German society along with their privileges; their training also aimed at an obliteration of social and intellectual distinctions between the classes, so as to be replaced and dominated by the political goals of Hitlers totalitarian dictatorship.

This organisation within the Hitler Youth was a training ground for future labor leaders and technicians. Its symbol was a rising sun with a swastika.     The Hitler Youth regularly issued the Wille und Macht monthly magazine. This publication was also its official organ and its editor was Baldur von Schirach. Other publications included Die Kameradschaft , which had a girls version for the BDM called Mädelschaft, and a yearbook called Jungen eure Welt .     Another program entitled Landjahr Lager was designed to teach specifically chosen girls of the BDM high moral character standards within a rural educational setting.            In 42 the youth organisation of the Nazi Party had a little over 42 members. In 42 when the Nazi Party had been refounded, the membership grew to over 42. Five years later, national membership stood at 42. By the end of 42 it was at 42. The Nazis came to power in 42 and the membership of Hitler Youth organisations increased dramatically to 42,42 members by the end of that year. Much of these increases came from forcible takeovers of other youth organisations. The sizeable Evangelische Jugend , a Lutheran youth organisation of 42 members, was integrated on 42 February 42 In 42 a law declared the Hitler Youth to be the only legally permitted youth organisation in Germany, and stated that all of the German youth in the Reich is organised within the Hitler Youth .

Parents who refused to allow their children to join were subject to an investigation by the authorities. From then on, the vast majority of Germanys teenagers belonged to the Hitler Youth. By 42 it had eight million members.     Even before membership was made mandatory in 42 German youth faced strong pressure to join.

Rempel also reports that a large percentage of the boys who served in the HJ slowly came to the realization that they had worked and slaved for a criminal cause , which they carried for a lifetime; some of them recalled a loss of freedom and claimed their time in the HJ had robbed them of a normal childhood.  Historian Michael Kater relates how many who once served in the HJ were silent until older age when they became grandparents, and while they were eventually able to look back at their place in a dictatorship which oppressed, maimed, and killed millions , he maintains that an honest appraisal should lead them to conclude that their past contributions to the regime had damaged their own souls.
