Stories persist that the episode was seen by so many people that the New York City Sanitation/Public Works Department reported the plumbing systems broke down in some parts of the city from so many New Yorkers waiting until the end to use the toilet. Articles copied into Alan Aldas book The Last Days of MASH include interviews with New York City Sanitation workers citing the spike in water use on that night.
