When it was originally established in 1961 as a wildlife sanctuary the Mara covered only  of the current area, including the Mara Triangle. The area was extended to the east in 1961 to cover  and converted to a game reserve. The Narok County Council took over management of the reserve at this time. Part of the reserve was given National Reserve status in 1974, and the remaining area of  was returned to local communities. An additional  were removed from the reserve in 1976, and the park was reduced to  in 1984.     In 1994, the TransMara County Council was formed in the western part of the reserve, and control was divided between the new council and the existing Narok County Council. In May 2001, the not-for-profit Mara Conservancy took over management of the Mara Triangle.     Kenya was colonized by British colonial forces up until 1963 when Kenya gained independence. Prior to Kenyan independence, Eastern Africa and much of Africa as a whole, Kenya experienced extreme measures of colonization that has left long lasting negative effects on the country. For example, the establishment of the Maasai Mara National Reserve and Mara Triangle was brought forward by British colonists that wanted to preserve the African wildlife and landscape. The British thought that the local people in the area were causing more harm than they were goos. These establishments completely ignored local communities, which ultimately displaced local peoples from their lands.     The Maasai Mara National Reserve is named specifically after the Maasai people.The Maasai people make up a community that spans across norther, central and southern Kenya and northern parts of Tanzania. As pastoralists, the community holds the belief that they own all of the cattle in the world. The Maasai rely off of their lands to sustain their cattle, as well as themselves and their families. Prior to the establishment of the Mara Triangle and Maasai Mara, the Maasai lived on the land where the current reservers are located. Once the Maasai Mara was declared a national reservation as a conservation area for the protection of wildlife and wilderness, the Maasai were forced to move out of their native lands. The Mara displaced thousands of Maasai, where the community lost culturally significant areas and has put harsh pressures on cattle grazing.

The Mara Predator Project also operates in the Maasai Mara, cataloging and monitoring lion populations throughout the region.  Concentrating on the northern conservancies where communities coexist with wildlife, the project aims to identify population trends and responses to changes in land management, human settlements, livestock movements and tourism. Sara Blackburn, the project manager, works in partnership with a number of lodges in the region by training guides to identify lions and report sightings. Guests are also encouraged to participate in the project by photographing lions seen on game drives. An online database of individual lions is openly accessible, and features information on project participants and focus areas.      Since October 2012, the Mara-Meru Cheetah Project  is working in the Mara monitoring cheetah population, estimating population status and dynamics, and evaluating the predator impact and human activity on cheetah behavior and survival. The head of the Project, Elena Chelysheva, was working in 2001-2002 as Assistant Researcher at the Kenya Wildlife Service Maasai-Mara Cheetah Conservation Project. At that time, she developed original method of cheetah identification based on visual analysis of the unique spot patterns on front limbs and hind limbs , and spots and rings on the tail.  Collected over the years, photographic data allows the project team to trace kinship between generations and build Mara cheetah pedigree. The data collected helps to reveal parental relationship between individuals, survival rate of cubs, cheetah lifespan and personal reproductive history. This work has never been done before and the team is sharing results with the Mara stakeholders and respondents. The ongoing research is a follow-up study, which will compare results with the previous one in terms of cheetah population status and effect of human activity on cheetah behavior and surviving. The project is working in affiliation with Kenya Wildlife Service, Narok and Transmara County Councils and with assistance of Coordinator of Maasai-Mara Cultural Village Tour Association . The team is cooperating with Mara Hyena Project and working with managers and driver-guides from over 30 different Mara camps and lodges. Rangers and driver/guides are trained in cheetah identification techniques and provided with catalogues of the Mara cheetahs.     The Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust is an organization whose mission statement states the following: The Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust works to protect the legendary ecosystems and astounding biodiversity of East Africa through conservation that directly benefits local Maasai communities. While the MWCT was founded by an American, Edward Norton, the team is composed largely of Maasai peoples. This organization is prized off of their assistance provided in the local communities that have faced sever threats to their land and ultimately their culture as a whole. While research conducted on wildlife within the Mara is an important factor is sustaining ecotourism and a healthy ecosystem, its equally important that organizations work to ensure a successful future for local communities that have been effected by the park.

While visiting national reserves or parks in Eastern Africa, its important to research the history of spaces as a tourist, to gain a better understanding and obtain a deeper knowledge of the area. The continent of Africa in particular was affected in a negative manner by colonization, which has long lasting effects on the history of the continent as a whole. Tourists have gained a reputation for coming to these African landscapes, taking a photo and then quickly fleeing, while leaving their ecological waste and carbon footprint behind. In attempts to gain a better reputation for tourist, researching spaces and acknowledging the past history of Kenya and Eastern Africa is essential in mitigating this issue.
