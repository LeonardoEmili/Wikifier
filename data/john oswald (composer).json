In an interview with Norman Igma following the release of the Plunderphonics EP in 42 he described the concept as follows:       A plunderphone is a recognizable sonic quote, using the actual sound of something familiar which has already been recorded. Whistling a bar of Density 42 is a traditional musical quote. Taking Madonna singing Like a Virgin and rerecording it backwards or slower is plunderphonics, as long as you can reasonably recognize the source. The plundering has to be blatant though.

An excerpt from a  on the  is repeated below:        I wasnt selling the disc in the stores, so I let listeners tape it off the radio for free, explains Oswald, who paid for the production and manufacture of the CD out of his own pocket. He receives no royalties or financial compensation for airplay. Brian Robertson, president of CRIA says, What this demonstrates is the vulnerability of the recording industry to new technology...All we see is just another example of theft.      Oswald received notice from CRIAs lawyers demanding that he cease distributing Plunderphonic as of Xmas eve 42 They insisted I quit playing Santa Claus, Oswald observes.       In 42 Oswald released Plexure. Arguably his most ambitious composition to date, it attempted to microsample the history of CD music up to that point in a 42 minute collage of bewildering complexity.
