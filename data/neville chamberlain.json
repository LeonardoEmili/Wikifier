Eden believed that Chamberlain was being too hasty in talking with Italy and holding out the prospect of  de jure  recognition of Italys conquest of Ethiopia. Chamberlain concluded that Eden would have to accept his policy or resign. The Cabinet heard both men out but unanimously decided for Chamberlain, and despite efforts by other Cabinet members to prevent it, Eden resigned from office. In later years, Eden tried to portray his resignation as a stand against appeasement  but many ministers and MPs believed there was no issue at stake worth resignation. Chamberlain appointed Lord Halifax as Foreign Secretary in Edens place.       In March 1938 Austria became a part of Germany in the Anschluß . Though the beleaguered Austrians requested help from Britain, none was forthcoming. Britain did send Berlin a strong note of protest. In addressing the Cabinet shortly after German forces crossed the border, Chamberlain placed blame on both Germany and Austria. Chamberlain noted,          On 14 March, the day after the Anschluß, Chamberlain addressed the House of Commons and strongly condemned the methods used by the Germans in the takeover of Austria.

After the fall of Austria, the Cabinets Foreign Policy Committee considered seeking a grand alliance to thwart Germany or, alternatively, an assurance to France of assistance if the French went to war. Instead, the committee chose to advocate that Czechoslovakia be urged to make the best terms it could with Germany. The full Cabinet agreed with the committees recommendation, influenced by a report from the chiefs of staff stating that there was little that Britain could do to help the Czechs in the event of a German invasion. Chamberlain reported to an amenable House that he was unwilling to limit his governments discretion by giving commitments.     Britain and Italy signed an agreement in April 1938.

This incident caused unrest among the Sudeten Germans, and Germany was then said to be moving troops to the border. In response to the report, Prague moved troops to the German border. Halifax sent a note to Germany warning that if France intervened in the crisis on Czechoslovakias behalf, Britain might support France. Tensions appeared to calm, and Chamberlain and Halifax were applauded for their masterly handling of the crisis. Though it was not known at the time, it later became clear that Germany had had no plans for a May invasion of Czechoslovakia.

At last Hitler addressed his wildly enthusiastic followers:          The following morning, 13 September, Chamberlain and the Cabinet were informed by Secret Service sources that all German embassies had been told that Germany would invade Czechoslovakia on 25 September. Convinced that the French would not fight , Chamberlain decided to implement Plan Z and sent a message to Hitler that he was willing to come to Germany to negotiate.

After the meeting Chamberlain returned to London, believing that he had obtained a breathing space during which agreement could be reached and the peace preserved. Under the proposals made at Berchtesgaden the Sudetenland would be annexed by Germany if a plebiscite in the Sudetenland favoured it. Czechoslovakia would receive international guarantees of its independence which would replace existing treaty obligations—principally the French pledge to the Czechoslovaks.

Hitler was unmoved.     That evening, Chamberlain told Lord Halifax that the meeting with Herr Hitler had been most unsatisfactory . The following day, Hitler kept Chamberlain waiting until mid-afternoon, when he sent a five-page letter, in German, outlining the demands he had made orally the previous day. Chamberlain replied by offering to act as an intermediary with the Czechoslovaks, and suggested that Hitler put his demands in a memorandum which could be circulated to the French and Czechoslovaks.     The leaders met again late on the evening of 23 September—a meeting which stretched into the early morning hours. Hitler demanded that fleeing Czechs in the zones to be occupied take nothing with them. He extended his deadline for occupation of the Sudetenland to 1 October—the date he had long before secretly set for the invasion of Czechoslovakia. The meeting ended amicably, with Chamberlain confiding to Hitler his hopes they would be able to work out other problems in Europe in the same spirit. Hitler hinted that the Sudetenland fulfilled his territorial ambitions in Europe. Chamberlain flew back to London, saying It is up to the Czechs now.        Hitlers proposals met with resistance not only from the French and Czechoslovaks, but also from some members of Chamberlains cabinet. With no agreement in sight, war seemed inevitable. The Prime Minister issued a press statement calling on Germany to abandon the threat of force in exchange for British help in obtaining the concessions it sought. On the evening of 27 September, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, and after thanking those who wrote to him, stated:          On 28 September, Chamberlain called on Hitler to invite him to Germany again to seek a solution through a summit involving the British, French, Germans, and Italians.

The four leaders debated the draft and Chamberlain raised the question of compensation for the Czechoslovak government and citizens, but Hitler refused to consider this.          The leaders were joined by advisors after lunch, and hours were spent on long discussions of each clause of the Italian draft agreement.

For the time being, therefore, we should relax no particle of effort until our deficiencies had been made good.  Later in October, he resisted calls to put industry on a war footing, convinced that such an action would show Hitler that the Prime Minister had decided to abandon Munich.

Despite Hitlers relative quietness as the Reich absorbed the Sudetenland, foreign policy concerns continued to preoccupy Chamberlain. He made trips to Paris and Rome, hoping to persuade the French to hasten their rearmament and Mussolini to be a positive influence on Hitler. Several of his Cabinet members, led by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, began to draw away from the appeasement policy. Halifax was by now convinced that Munich, though better than a European war, had been a horrid business and humiliating . Public revulsion over the pogrom of  Kristallnacht  on 9 November 1938 made any attempt at a rapprochement with Hitler unacceptable, though Chamberlain did not abandon his hopes.     Still hoping for reconciliation with Germany, Chamberlain made a major speech in Birmingham on 28 January 1939, in which he expressed his desire for international peace, and had an advance copy sent to Hitler at Berchtesgaden.

On 15 March 1939, Germany invaded the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, including Prague. Though Chamberlains initial parliamentary response was, according to biographer Nick Smart, feeble, within 48  hours he had spoken more forcefully against the German aggression. In another Birmingham speech, on 17 March, Chamberlain warned that no greater mistake could be made than to suppose that because it believes war to be a senseless and cruel thing the nation has so lost its fibre that it will not take part to the utmost of its power in resisting such a challenge if it were ever made.  The Prime Minister questioned whether the invasion of Czechoslovakia was the end of an old adventure, or the beginning of a new and whether it was a step in the direction of an attempt to dominate the world by force.

Because the use of the word friends was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues, and, according to biographer Robert Self, many MPs took it that way, it was an error of judgment for Chamberlain to refer to party loyalty when the gravity of the war situation required national unity.  Lloyd George joined the attackers, and Churchill concluded the debate with a vigorous speech in support of the government. When the division took place, the government, which had a normal majority of over 200, prevailed by only 81, with 38  MPs in receipt of the government whip voting against it, with between 20 and 25 abstaining.     Chamberlain spent much of 9 May in meetings with his Cabinet colleagues. Many Conservative MPs, even those who had voted against the government, indicated on 9 May and in the days following that they did not wish Chamberlain to depart but rather would seek to reconstruct his government.

Churchill returned the loyalty, refusing to consider Labour and Liberal attempts to expel Chamberlain from the government. When criticisms of Chamberlain appeared in the press, and when Chamberlain learned that Labour intended to use an upcoming secret session of Parliament as a platform to attack him, he told Churchill that he could only defend himself by attacking Labour. The Prime Minister intervened with the Labour Party and the press and the criticism ceased, according to Chamberlain, like turning off a tap .     In July 1940, a polemic titled  Guilty Men  was released by Cato —a pseudonym for three journalists . It attacked the record of the National Government, alleging that it had failed to prepare adequately for war. It called for the removal of Chamberlain and other ministers who had allegedly contributed to the British disasters of the early part of the war. The short book sold more than 200,000 copies, many of which were passed from hand-to-hand, and went into 27 editions in the first few months, despite not being carried by several major bookshops. According to historian David Dutton, its impact upon Chamberlains reputation, both among the general public and within the academic world, was profound indeed.      Chamberlain had long enjoyed excellent health, except for occasional attacks of gout, but by July 1940 he was in almost constant pain.

Chamberlains reputation was devastated by these attacks from the left. In 1948, with the publication of The Gathering Storm, the first volume of Churchills six-volume set,  The Second World War , Chamberlain sustained an even more serious assault from the right. While Churchill stated privately, this is not history, this is my case , his series was still hugely influential. Churchill depicted Chamberlain as well-meaning but weak, blind to the threat posed by Hitler, and oblivious to the fact that Hitler could have been removed from power by a grand coalition of European states. Churchill suggested that the years delay between Munich and war worsened Britains position, and criticised Chamberlain for both peacetime and wartime decisions.

While many revisionist writers had suggested that Chamberlain had had few or no choices in his actions, Parker argued that Chamberlain and his colleagues had chosen appeasement over other viable policies. In his two volumes, Chamberlain and Appeasement and Churchill and Appeasement , Parker stated that Chamberlain, due to his powerful, obstinate personality and his skill in debate, caused Britain to embrace appeasement instead of effective deterrence. Parker also suggested that had Churchill held high office in the second half of the 1930s Churchill would have built a series of alliances which would have deterred Hitler, and perhaps would have caused Hitlers domestic opponents to procure his removal.
