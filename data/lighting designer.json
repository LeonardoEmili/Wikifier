The LD must take into account the shows mood and the directors vision in creating a lighting design.     Because lighting design is much more abstract than costume or scenic design, it is sometimes difficult for the lighting designer to accurately convey his or her ideas to the rest of the production team. To help the LD communicate the ethereal aspects of lighting, he or she may employ renderings, storyboards, photographs, reproductions of artwork, or mockups of actual lighting effects to help communicate ideas about how the lighting should look. Various forms of paperwork are essential for the LD to successfully communicate their design to various members of the production team.

Often, changes will take place during notes call, but if serious problems occur the performance may be halted and the issue will be resolved then.     Once the show is open to the public, the lighting designer will often stay and watch several performances of the show, making notes each night and making desired changes the next day during notes call. If the show is still in previews, then the LD will make changes, but once the production officially opens, normally the lighting designer will not make further changes.     Changes should not be made after the lighting design is finished, and never without the LDs approval. There may be times when changes are necessary after the production has officially opened. Reasons for changes after opening night include: casting changes; significant changes in blocking; addition, deletion or rearrangement of scenes; or the tech and/or preview period was too short to accommodate as thorough a cueing as was needed . If significant changes need to be made, the LD will come in and make them, however if only smaller changes are needed, the LD may opt to send the ALD. If a show runs for a particularly long time then the LD may come in periodically to check the focus of each lighting instrument and if they are retaining their color . The LD may also sit in on a performance to make sure that the cues are still being called at the right place and time. The goal is often to finish by the opening of the show, but what is most important is that the LD and the directors believe that the design is finished to eachs satisfaction. If that happens to be by opening night, then after opening no changes are normally made to that particular production run at that venue. The general maintenance of the lighting rig then becomes the responsibility of the Master Electrician.       It is uncommon for a small theatre to have a very large technical crew, as there is less work to do. Many times, the lighting crew of a small theatre will consist of a single lighting designer and one to three people, who collectively are in charge of hanging, focusing and patching all lighting instruments. The lighting designer, in this situation, commonly works directly with this small team, fulfilling the role of both master electrician and lighting designer. Many times the designer will directly participate in the focusing of lights. The same crew will generally also program cues and operate the ": null

The lighting designer may also take on other roles in addition to lights when they are finished hanging lights and programming cues on the board.          As previously mentioned, it is difficult to fully communicate the intent of a lighting design before all the lights are installed and all the cues are written.

The lighting designer enters the light plot into the visualization software and then enters the ground plan of the theater and set design, giving as much three-dimensional data as possible . This creates a 42D model in computer space that can be lit and manipulated. Using the software, the LD can use the lights from his plot to create actual lighting in the 42D model with the ability to define parameters such as color, focus, gobo, beam angle etc. The designer can then take renderings or snapshots of various looks that can then be printed out and shown to the director and other members of the design team.         In addition to computer visualization, either full scale or small scale mock ups are a good method for depicting a lighting designers ideas. Fiber optic systems such as LightBox or Luxam allow a users to light a scale model of the set. For example, a set designer can create a model of the set in 42/42 scale, the lighting designer can then take the fiber optic cables and attach them to scaled down lighting units that can accurately replicate the beam angles of specified lighting fixtures. These mini lights can then be attached to cross pieces simulating different lighting positions. Fiber optic fixtures have the capacity to simulate attributes of full scale theatrical lighting fixtures including; color, beam angle, intensity, and gobos.

If the production is large or especially complex, the Lighting Designer may hire additional lighting professionals to help execute the design.       The Associate Lighting Designer will help assist the Lighting Designer in creating and executing the lighting design. While the duties that an LD may expect the Associate LD to perform may differ from person to person, usually the Asst LD will do the following:   Attend design and production meetings with or in place of the LD   Attend rehearsals with or in place of LD and take notes of specific design ideas and tasks that the lighting department needs to accomplish   Assist the LD in generating the light plot, channel hookup and sketches   If needed, the Associate may need to take the set drawings and put them into a CAD program to be manipulated by the LD .   The Asst LD may be in charge of running focus, and may even direct where the lights are to be focused.   The Associate is generally authorized to speak on behalf of the LD and can make creative and design decisions when needed . This is one of the biggest differences between the Associate and the Assistant.       The Assistant Lighting Designer assists the Lighting Designer and the Associate Lighting Designer. Depending on the particular arrangement the ALD may report directly to the LD, or they may in essence be the Associates assistant. There also may be more than one assistant on a show depending on the size of the production. The ALD will usually:   Attend design and production meetings with the LD or the Associate LD   Attend rehearsals with the LD or the Associate LD   Assist the LD in generating the light plot and channel hookup. If the plot is to be computer generated, the ALD is the one who physically enters the information into the computer.   The ALD may run errands for the LD such as picking up supplies or getting the light plot printed in large format.   The ALD will help the Associate LD in running focus.
