Now and then I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind. His book, Race, IQ and Jensen , is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.        A 1999 article published in  American Psychologist  summarises much of his research. On the alleged genetic inferiority of Blacks on IQ tests, he lays out the argument and evidence for such a belief and then contests each point. He interprets the direct evidence—when Blacks are raised in settings that are less disadvantageous—as suggesting that environmental factors explain genetic differences. And yet, he argues that the environmental explanation gained force after the discovery that IQ scores were rising over time. Inter-generational IQ differences among Whites and across nations were larger than the Black-White IQ Gap and could not be accounted for by genetic factors, which, if anything, should have reduced IQ, according to scholars he references. He posits that the Black-White IQ score gap can be entirely explained by environmental factors if the average environment for Blacks in 1995 matches the quality of the average environment for Whites in 1945 .

He advocates for open scientific debate about controversial social science claims, and is critical of the suppression of research into race and intelligence.  He urges those who believe in racial equality to use solid evidence to advance those beliefs.

In July 2012, several media outlets reported Flynn as claiming that women had, for the first time in a century, surpassed men on IQ tests based on a study he conducted in 2010.   However, Flynn announced that the media had seriously distorted his results and went beyond his claims, revealing that he had instead discovered that the differences between men and women on one particular test, the ": null

Women, he argued, caught up to men in these nations as a result of exposure to modernity by entering the professions and being allowed greater educational access. Therefore, he claimed, when a total account of the Flynn effect is considered, womens closing the gap had moved them up in IQ slightly faster than men as a result. Flynn had previously documented this same trend among ethnic minorities and other disadvantaged groups. According to Flynn, the sexes are dead equal on cognitive factors ... in their ability to deal with using logic on the abstract problems of Ravens, but that temperamental differences in the way boys and girls take the tests likely account for the tiny variations in mean scores, rather than any difference in intellectual ability.     In 2019 Flynn was told that his new book In Defence of Free Speech: The University as Censor would not be published by an English publisher who had previously accepted it and scheduled it for publication. But it was thought too controversial under the United Kingdoms laws about hate speech as the intent is irrelevant if it is thought likely that racial hatred could be stirred up as a result of the work.
