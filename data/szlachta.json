Members of the szlachta had the personal obligation to defend the country , thereby becoming the kingdoms most privileged social class. Inclusion in the class was almost exclusively based on inheritance.      Concerning the early Polish tribes, geography contributed to long-standing traditions. The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying religious cult, governed by the  wiec , an assembly of free tribesmen. Later, when safety required power to be consolidated, an elected prince was chosen to govern. The election privilege was usually limited to elites.     The tribes were ruled by clans  consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor, giving the ród/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity.  The  starosta   had judicial and military power over the ród/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. Strongholds called  grόd  were built where the religious cult was powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger.

Hundreds of such false nobles were denounced by Hieronim Nekanda Trepka in his  Liber generationis plebeanorum , or  Liber chamorum , in the first half of the 16th century. The law forbade non-nobles to own folwarks and promised such estates as a reward to denouncers. Trepka was himself an impoverished nobleman who lived a town dwellers life and documented hundreds of such false claims hoping to take over one of the usurped estates. He does not seem to have succeeded in his quest despite his employment as the kings secretary. Leszczyński, R.
