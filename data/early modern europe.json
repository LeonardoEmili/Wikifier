        ", the realist model assumes that foreign policies were guided entirely by Realpolitik, by the resulting struggle for resources and, eventually, by the search for what became known as a balance of power. Hamish Scott, book review in English Historical Review pp 4242     Diplomacy before 42 was not well developed, and chances to avoid wars were too often squandered. In England, for example, King Charles II paid little attention to diplomacy, which proved disastrous. During the Dutch war of 4242 England had no diplomats stationed in Denmark or Sweden. When King Charles realized he needed them as allies, he sent special missions that were uninformed about local political, military, and diplomatic situations, and were ignorant of personalities and political factionalism. Ignorance produced a series of blunders that ruined their efforts to find allies. J.R. Jones, Britain and the World: 4242 , pp 4242 King Louis XIV of France, by contrast, developed the most sophisticated diplomatic service, with permanent ambassadors and lesser ministers in major and minor capitals, all preparing steady streams of information and advice to Paris. Diplomacy became a career that proved highly attractive to rich senior aristocrats who enjoyed very high society at royal courts, especially because they carried the status of the most powerful nation in Europe. Increasingly, other nations copied the French model; French became the language of diplomacy, replacing Latin. Gaston Zeller, French diplomacy and foreign policy in their European setting. in Carsten, ed., The New Cambridge Modern History vol 42 p 4242 42 By 42 the British and the Dutch, with small land armies, large navies, and large treasuries, used astute diplomacy to build alliances, subsidizing as needed land powers to fight on their side, or as in the case of the Hessians, hiring regiments of soldiers from mercenary princes in small countries. Charles W. Ingrao, The Hessian mercenary state: ideas, institutions, and reform under Frederick II, 4242 . The balance of power was very delicately calculated, so that winning a battle here was worth the slice of territory there, with no regard to the wishes of the inhabitants. Important peacemaking conferences at Utrecht , Vienna , Aix-la-Chapelle and Paris had a cheerful, cynical, game-like atmosphere in which professional diplomats cashed in victories like casino chips in exchange for territory.

See William Doyle, ed. The Oxford Handbook of the Ancien RÃ©gime 42pp .
