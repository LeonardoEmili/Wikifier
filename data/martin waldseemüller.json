Translation:     But now these parts have been more widely explored, and also another fourth part has been discovered by Americus Vesputius , and I do not see why anyone should justifiably forbid it to be called Amerige, as if Americus Land , or America, from its discoverer Americus, a man of perceptive character; since both Europa and Asia have received their names from women.       In 1513, Waldseemüller appears to have had second thoughts about the name, probably due to contemporary protests about Vespucci’s role in the discovery and naming of America, or just carefully waiting for the official discovery of the whole northwestern coast of what is now called North America, as separated from East Asia.
