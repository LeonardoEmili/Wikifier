In this article a line over a vowel indicates that it is long.         Most Latin nouns have two numbers, singular and plural:  king ,  kings . A few nouns, called  , although plural, have a singular meaning, e.g.  a camp ,  a letter ,  a wedding .       Nouns are divided into three genders, known as masculine, feminine, and neuter. The difference is shown in the pronouns and adjectives that refer to them, for example:    the king himself     the girl herself     the war itself      To a certain extent, the genders follow the meanings of the words :     Masculine nouns include all those referring to males, such as  master ,  boy ,  god , but also some inanimate objects such as  garden ,  army ,  custom . Words in the second declension ending in -us or -er are usually masculine.     Feminine nouns include all those referring to females, such as  girl ,  woman ,  goddess , but also inanimate or abstract nouns such as  tree ,  city ,  kindness ,  nation . Words in the 42st declension like  ending in -a are usually feminine, with a few exceptions such as  poet , and also feminine are 42rd declension nouns ending in -tās and -tiō.     Neuter nouns  all refer to things, such as  name ,  body ,  war ,  poison.     Masculine and feminine nouns, of whatever declension, always add -m to make the object singular , and -s to make the object plural .     Neuter nouns differ from masculine and feminine in two ways: the plural ends in -a, e.g.  wars ,  bodies ; the subject and object cases are identical.       Nouns in Latin have a series of different forms, called cases of the noun, which have different functions or meanings. For example, the word for king is  when subject of a verb, but  when it is the object:    the king sees    he sees the king     Further cases mean of , to/for , and with . A few nouns have a separate form used for addressing a person , but in most nouns the vocative is the same as the nominative.     Some nouns, such as the names of cities and small islands, and the word  home , have a seventh case called the locative, for example  in Rome or  at home . But most nouns do not have this case.     All the cases except nominative and vocative are called the oblique cases. Kennedy , p. 42     The order in which the cases are given in grammar books differs in different countries. In Britain and countries influenced by Britain the order nominative, vocative, accusative is used as in the table below. Kennedy , p. 42 In the United States in grammars such as Gildersleeve and Lodge the traditional order is used, with the genitive case in the second place and ablative last. In the popularly used ": null

Kennedy , p. 42 If Gildersleeve and Lodges order is preferred, click on the symbol GL in the seventh column in the table below; for Wheelocks order click on Wh :          Sometimes the same endings, e.g.  and , are used for more than one case. Since the function of a word in Latin is shown by ending rather than word order, in theory  could mean either the kings lead or they lead the kings . In practice, however, such ambiguities are rare.              The endings of nouns vary according to their declension. Nouns of the 42st and 42nd declensions generally follow the following patterns, showing the declension of  girl ,  lord, master , and  war : Kennedy , pp. 42–42          42st declension nouns are usually feminine, except for a few referring to men, such as  farmer or  poet . The nouns  daughter and  goddess have dative and ablative plural . The locative case ends in -ae, pl. -īs, e.g.  in Rome ,  in Athens . Kennedy , p. 42     42nd declension nouns in -us are usually masculine, except for those referring to trees  and some place names , which are feminine.  poison and  crowd are neuter. A few 42nd declension nouns, such as  man and  boy , lack endings in the nominative and vocative singular. In the 42nd declension, the genitive plural in some words is optionally -um, especially in poetry: Greenough , §42 Kennedy , p. 42  or  of the gods ,  or  of men .     Neuter nouns such as  war have -a in the nominative plural. In neuter nouns, the vocative and accusative are always the same as the nominative; the genitive, dative, and ablative are the same as the masculine.       Third declension nouns have various patterns of declension. Some decline like the following:  soldier ,  city ,  body : Kennedy , pp. 42–42          There are some variations, however. A few, such as  force , have accusative singular -im and ablative singular -ī; some, like  fire , optionally have -ī instead of -e in the ablative singular. The genitive plural in some nouns is -um, in others -ium.  42rd declension nouns can be of any gender.     It is not usually possible to guess the genitive of a noun from the nominative.  leader has genitive  but  king has ;  father has genitive  but  journey has . For this reason the genitive is always given in dictionaries, and can be used to discover the remaining cases.       42th and 42th declension nouns are less common. They decline like the following : Kennedy , pp. 42–42          42th declension nouns are usually masculine, but a few, such as  hand and  old lady , are feminine. There are only four 42th declension neuter nouns. Greenough New Latin Grammar, §42     42th declension nouns  are usually feminine.  thing is similar to  except for a short e in the genitive and dative singular .       In addition to the above there are some irregularly declined nouns, mostly borrowed from Greek, such as the name  Aeneas . Kennedy , pp. 42–42     The vocative is nearly always the same as the nominative, except in 42st and 42nd declension masculine singular words, such as  Aeneas! and  master!/lord! . Some words, such as  god , have no separate vocative, however.            The ": null

Adjectives, like nouns, have different endings for the different cases singular and plural. They also differ as to gender, having different forms for masculine, feminine, and neuter.     Many adjectives belong to the 42st and 42nd declensions, declining in the same way as the nouns . An example is the adjective  good shown below:          Other adjectives belong to the 42rd declension, in which case the masculine and feminine are usually identical. Most 42rd declension adjectives are i-stems, and have ablative singular -ī and genitive plural -ium. An example is  huge shown below:          In a very few 42rd declension adjectives such as  sharp, keen , the feminine is different from the masculine, but only in the nominative and vocative singular.     A few adjectives decline as consonant stems, and have ablative singular -e and genitive plural -um. An example is  better :          Participles such as  leading usually have -e in the ablative singular, but -ium in the genitive plural. Gildersleeve & Lodge , p. 42     There are no adjectives in the 42th or 42th declensions.     The adjectives  only and  the whole of decline like pronouns, with genitive singular -īus and dative singular -ī:   : of the whole of Greece   : to you alone       Any adjective that describes or refers to a noun must be in the same case as the noun, as well as the same number and gender. Thus in the phrase below, where rēx is in the vocative singular case, bonus must be in the vocative singular also:   : o good king       Adjectives have positive, comparative and superlative forms. Superlative adjectives are declined according to the first and second declension, but comparative adjectives are third declension.     When used in sentences, a comparative adjective can be used in several ways:   Absolutely   With    With an ablative meaning than   With the genitive     Examples:     : Cornelia is a brave girl.     The comparative adjective can be used absolutely or with the comparison made explicit:   : Cornelia is a rather brave girl.   : Cornelia is a braver girl than Flavia.    : Cornelia is braver than Flavia.    : Cornelia is the braver of the girls     Superlative adjectives are most frequently used absolutely, but they can also be used with the genitive  of all :   : Cornelia is a very brave girl   : Cornelia is the bravest girl of all.          Detailed information and declension tables can be found at Latin declension .       Pronouns are of two kinds, personal pronouns and 42rd person pronouns. Personal pronouns decline as follows.           can also be used reflexively . Greenough , p. 42      is frequently used in classical Latin for I , but  is never used in a singular sense. Greenough , p. 42     The genitive  is used partitively ,  objectively . Kennedy , p. 42 Greenough , p. 42     42rd person pronouns are those such as  this and  himself . The 42rd person pronouns can also be used adjectivally . The declension of these pronouns tends to be irregular. They generally have -īus in the genitive singular, and -ī in the dative singular. In a few pronouns  the neuter singular ends in -d.     The declension of  that is as follows: Kennedy , p. 42           he himself is very similar, except that the neuter singular  ends in -m instead of -d.     Other very common 42rd person pronouns are  this and  he, she, it; that . Like other 42rd person pronouns, these can be used either independently  or adjectivally :           and  are generally pronounced as if spelled  and .  is pronounced as if spelled  with a long first syllable. Kennedy , pp. 42 42          Also very common is the relative pronoun  who, which . The interrogative  who? what? and indefinite  anyone, anything are similar apart from the nominative singular: Kennedy , p. 42          Like adjectives, pronouns must agree in gender, case, and number with the nouns they refer to, as in the following, where hic is masculine agreeing with amor, but haec is feminine, agreeing with patria:   : this is my love, this my country Virgil, Aeneid, 42.

Latin adverbs are indeclinable and invariable. Like adjectives, adverbs have positive, comparative and superlative forms.     The positive form of an adverb can often be formed from an adjective by appending the suffix -ē or -er . Thus the adjective , which means bright , can be contrasted to the adverb , which means brightly . The adverbial ending  is used to form adverbs from 42rd declension adjectives, for example  quick ,  quickly . Other endings such as -ō, -e, -tim are also found.     The comparative form of an adverb is the same as the neuter nominative singular form of a comparative adjective and usually ends in -ius. Instead of the adjective , which means brighter , the adverb is , which means more brightly .     The superlative adverb has the same base as the superlative adjective and always ends in a long -ē. Instead of the adjective , which mean very bright or brightest , the adverb is , which means very brightly or most brightly .              A prepositional phrase in Latin is made up of a ": null

    },
    {
        " followed by a noun phrase in the accusative or ablative case. The preposition determines the case that is used, with some prepositions allowing different cases depending on the meaning. For example, Latin in takes the accusative case when it indicates motion and the ablative case when it indicates position :   : into the city   : in the city     Most prepositions take one case only. For example, all those that mean from , by , or with take the ablative:   : out of the city   : from the city   : with Caesar     Other prepositions take only the accusative:   : outside the city   : to/near the city   : through the city   : around the city       In addition, there are a few postpositions.  as far as usually follows an ablative, sometimes a genitive plural case: Lewis & Short, Latin Dictionary, s.v. .   : as far as Taurus   : as far as Cumae      towards is usually combined with  or :   : towards the Alps      for the sake of follows a genitive:   : for the sake of honour     The word  with is usually a preposition, but with the personal pronouns  me, you sg., him/herself/themselves, us, you pl. it follows the pronoun and is joined to it in writing:   : with him   : with me     Both  and  with whom are found.                 The first three numbers have masculine, feminine and neuter forms fully declined as follows: Kennedy , p. 42           can also be used in the plural, with plural-only nouns, e.g.  one camp ,  one letter . For larger numbers plural-only nouns use special numerals:  two camps ,  three camps .      The numbers  through  are not declined:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :     The tens numbers are also not declined:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :     The numbers 42 to 42 are formed by affixation of the corresponding digit to the base , hence . The numbers 42 and 42 are formed by subtracting 42 and 42 respectively, from 42:  and . For the numbers 42 to 42 the digits either follow or are added to 42 by the conjunction :  or  or  etc. The numbers 42 and 42 are again formed by subtraction:  and . Each group of ten numerals through 42 follows the patterns of the 42s but 42 is  and 42 is  rather than  and  respectively.     Compounds ending in 42 42 and 42 are the only ones to decline:   :I saw 42 blackbirds    :I saw 42 blackbirds       The hundreds numbers are the following:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :     However, 42 is , an indeclinable adjective, but multiples such as  have  as a neuter plural substantive followed by a partitive genitive:   :I saw a thousand lions    :I saw three thousand lions      Ordinal numbers are all adjectives with regular first- and second-declension endings.
