        " in 42       The black sharecroppers family is poor and hungry. The father and his dog, Sounder, go hunting each night, but the hunting is inadequate. The family subsists on fried corn mush, biscuits, and milk gravy until one morning they wake up to the smell of boiling ham. They feast for three days, but finally the sheriff and two of his deputies burst into the cabin and arrest the father for stealing the ham. Sounder chases after them, and one of the deputies shoots him with a shotgun.     The arrested mans son goes looking for Sounder but cannot find him. Returning to the scene of the shooting, the boy finds a part of Sounders ear. While his mother cautions him not to be all hope , the boy searches for the dog every day for weeks. In the fathers absence, the family survives on the money the mother makes by selling cracked walnuts. The boy helps to look after his three younger siblings and experiences the intense loneliness of the cabin.     For Christmas, the boys mother makes a four-layer cake for him to take to his father in jail. When he arrives, the guard treats him rudely. Finally the boy is admitted, and the guard breaks the cake into pieces, saying he suspects it could hide something which could help the boys father escape. The boy gives the mangled cake to his father anyway and tells him that Sounder might not be dead. Their conversation is strained and difficult. The father tells the boy not to come back to the jail, and he goes home.     In the morning, the boy awakes to the sound of faint whining, goes outside, and finds Sounder standing there. The dog can only use three legs, has only one ear and one eye, and no longer barks. The boy and his mother tend to the dog.     When the family receives word that the father was convicted and sentenced to hard labor, traveling county to county, the boy resolves to search for his father. During the late fall and winter months over a period of several years, he journeys within and among counties, looking for convicts working, seeking word of his father. He also tries with some success to teach himself to read newspapers.     One day he is leaning against a fence, watching a group, trying to make out his fathers form, when a guard whacks the boy on the fingers with a piece of iron and tells him to leave. While the boy walks toward the outskirts of town, he sees someone putting a book in a trashcan. It is a large volume of ": null

        ", and the boy takes it with him. He finds a school where he tries to wash the blood off his hands. While he is at the pump, the boy meets an old teacher who dresses his wounds and asks what happened to him. The boy tells the teacher about Sounder and his father and, observing the book, the teacher extends an offer to the boy to live with him and learn to read. The boys mother tells him to go, and he stays with the teacher during the winter, working in the fields in summer.     One August day, the boy is at home helping with chores when they see his father walking toward them. One side of his fathers body is crippled from being crushed in a quarry. Sounder, who has anticipated the mans return for days, runs out to meet him and barks.     Weeks later, the man and his dog go hunting for the first time since the mans return. The man has been waiting until he can invite his son, but now he sees that the boy is tired from fieldwork, and the man further senses that the activity might no longer interest the boy. At dawn, Sounder comes back without his master and, when the boy follows Sounder to the man, he finds him dead. When the boy returns to the teacher, he tells his mother that Sounder will be dead before he can come back for the holiday. Two weeks before Christmas, Sounder crawls under the porch and dies. Despite their deaths, there is a sense of peace and resolution over the family - especially for the boy, who has achieved the thing he most wanted - to learn to read.
