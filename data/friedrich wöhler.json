This Wöhler Myth, as historian of science Peter J. Ramberg called it, originated from a popular history of chemistry published in 1931, which, ignoring all pretense of historical accuracy, turned Wöhler into a crusader who made attempt after attempt to synthesize a natural product that would refute vitalism and lift the veil of ignorance, until one afternoon the miracle happened . Ramberg , following Rocke , pp. 239–241, traced back the origin to H. Kopp’s Geschichte der Chemie, Vol. 1 , p. 442; vol. 4 , p. 244.
