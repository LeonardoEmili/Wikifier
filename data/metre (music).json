This perception and abstraction of rhythmic bar is the foundation of human instinctive musical participation, as when we divide a series of identical clock-ticks into tick–tock–tick–tock . Rhythms of recurrence arise from the interaction of two levels of motion, the faster providing the pulse and the slower organizing the beats into repetitive groups . In his book The Rhythms of Tonal Music, Joel Lester notes that, ce a metric hierarchy has been established, we, as listeners, will maintain that organization as long as minimal evidence is present .        Meter may be defined as a regular, recurring pattern of strong and weak beats. This recurring pattern of durations is identified at the beginning of a composition by a meter signature . ...
