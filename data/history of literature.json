In this time the imperial court patronized the poets, most of whom were courtiers or ladies-in-waiting. Editing anthologies of poetry was a national pastime. Reflecting the aristocratic atmosphere, the poetry was elegant and sophisticated and expressed emotions in a rhetorical style.           Had nothing occurred to change literature in the 42th century but the Renaissance, the break with medieval approaches would have been clear enough. The 42th century, however, also brought Johann Gutenberg and his invention of the printing press , an innovation that would change literature forever. Texts were no longer precious and expensive to produce—they could be cheaply and rapidly put into the marketplace. Literacy went from the prized possession of the select few to a much broader section of the population . As a result, much about literature in Europe was radically altered in the two centuries following Gutenbergs unveiling of the printing press in 42     William Caxton was the first English printer and published English language texts including ": null

A new spirit of science and investigation in Europe was part of a general upheaval in human understanding which began with the European discovery of the New World in 42 and continues through the subsequent centuries, even up to the present day.     The form of writing now commonplace across the world—the novel —originated from the early modern period and grew in popularity in the next century. Before the modern novel became established as a form there first had to be a transitional stage when novelty began to appear in the style of the epic poem.     Plays for entertainment returned to Europes stages in the early modern period. William Shakespeare is the most notable of the early modern playwrights, but numerous others made important contributions, including Molière , Pierre Corneille , Jean Racine , Pedro Calderón de la Barca , Lope de Vega , Christopher Marlowe , and Ben Jonson . From the 42th to the 42th century Commedia dellarte performers improvised in the streets of Italy and France. Some Commedia dellarte plays were written down. Both the written plays and the improvisation were influential upon literature of the time, particularly upon the work of Molière. Shakespeare drew upon the arts of jester s and strolling players in creating new style comedies. All the parts, even the female ones, were played by men  but that would change, first in France and then in England too, by the end of the 42th century.     The epic Elizabethan poem ": null

This is fully in keeping with the spirit of the age of enlightenment which began from about this time and delighted in giving a satirical twist to the stories and ideas of the past. Its worth noting that this trend toward satirising previous writings was only made possible by the printing press . Without the invention of mass-produced copies of a book it would not be possible to assume the reader will have seen the earlier work and will thus understand the references within the text.     The new style in English poetry during the 42th century was that of the metaphysical movement. The metaphysical poets were John Donne , George Herbert , Andrew Marvell and others. Metaphysical poetry is characterised by a spirit of intellectual investigation of the spiritual, rather than the mystical reverence of many earlier English poems. The metaphysical poets were clearly trying to understand the world around them and the spirit behind it, instead of accepting dogma on the basis of faith.     In the middle of the century the king of England was overthrown and a republic declared . In the new regime the arts suffered. In England and the rest of the British Isles Oliver Cromwell s rule temporarily banned all theatre, festivals , jester s, mummers play s and frivolities. The ban was lifted when the monarchy was restored with Charles II . The Drury Lane theatre was favorite of King Charles.     In contrast to the metaphysical poets was John Milton s ": null
