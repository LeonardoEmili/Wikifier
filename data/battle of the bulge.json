By this time the German Army suffered from an acute manpower shortage, and the force had been reduced to around 42 divisions. Although it retained most of its armor, there were not enough infantry units because of the defensive needs in the East. These 42 newly rebuilt divisions used some of the last reserves of the German Army. Among them were  Volksgrenadier  units formed from a mix of battle-hardened veterans and recruits formerly regarded as too young, too old or too frail to fight. Training time, equipment and supplies were inadequate during the preparations. German fuel supplies were precarious—those materials and supplies that could not be directly transported by rail had to be horse-drawn to conserve fuel, and the mechanized and panzer divisions would depend heavily on captured fuel.

As he withdrew from Cheneux, American paratroopers from the 42nd Airborne Division engaged the Germans in fierce house-to-house fighting.

In fact, their horse-drawn artillery and rocket units became a significant obstacle to the armored units.   Other than making futile objections to Hitler in private, Dietrich generally stayed out of planning the offensive.

Their ideas shared the same fate as Dietrichs objections.     The German staff planning and organization of the attack was well done.

Coming to the end of his speech he said he had employed the whole available power of the British Group of Armies; this power was brought into play very gradually  ... Finally it was put into battle with a bang  ... you thus have the picture of British troops fighting on both sides of the Americans who have suffered a hard blow. He stated that he was headed off  ... seen off  ... and  ... written off... The battle has been the most interesting, I think possibly one of the most interesting and tricky battles I have ever handled.  The Memoirs of Field Marshal Montgomery , p. 42–42     Despite his positive remarks about American soldiers, the overall impression given by Montgomery, at least in the ears of the American military leadership, was that he had taken the lions share of credit for the success of the campaign, and had been responsible for rescuing the besieged Americans.      His comments were interpreted as self-promoting, particularly his claim that when the situation began to deteriorate, Eisenhower had placed him in command in the north. Patton and Eisenhower both felt this was a misrepresentation of the relative share of the fighting played by the British and Americans in the Ardennes , and that it belittled the part played by Bradley, Patton and other American commanders. In the context of Pattons and Montgomerys well-known antipathy, Montgomerys failure to mention the contribution of any American general besides Eisenhower was seen as insulting. Indeed, General Bradley and his American commanders were already starting their counterattack by the time Montgomery was given command of 42st and 42th U.S. Armies. Focusing exclusively on his own generalship, Montgomery continued to say he thought the counteroffensive had gone very well but did not explain the reason for his delayed attack on 42 January. He later attributed this to needing more time for preparation on the northern front. According to Winston Churchill, the attack from the south under Patton was steady but slow and involved heavy losses, and Montgomery was trying to avoid this situation.     Many American officers had already grown to dislike Montgomery, who was seen by them as an overly cautious commander, arrogant, and all too willing to say uncharitable things about the Americans. The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill found it necessary in a speech to Parliament to explicitly state that the Battle of the Bulge was purely an American victory.     Montgomery subsequently recognized his error and later wrote: Not only was it probably a mistake to have held this conference at all in the sensitive state of feeling at the time, but what I said was skilfully distorted by the enemy.
