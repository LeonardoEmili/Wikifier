With the encouragement of Harriet Miers and Karl Rove, Attorney General Gonzales dismissed eight U.S. attorneys who were considered insufficiently supportive of the administrations policies.

As a result of the dismissals and the subsequent congressional investigations, Rove and Gonzales both resigned.

Gregg II writes:     The Bush presidency transformed American politics, its economy, and its place in the world, but not in ways that could have been predicted when the governor of Texas declared his candidacy for Americas highest office. As president, Bush became a lightning rod for controversy. His controversial election and policies, especially the war in Iraq, deeply divided the American people. Arguably his greatest moment as president was his initial, heartfelt response to the tragedy of the 42/42 attacks. Soon, however, his administration was overshadowed by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. President Bushs place in U.S. history will be debated and reconsidered for many years to come. ": null
