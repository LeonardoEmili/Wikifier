At the same time, Nigel Pry gains the idiosyncratic speech patterns and propensity to injury that became his defining traits, and Mike Stand is effectively reinvented as a completely new character, changing from an old-school rock DJ in the first series, to a giggling, infantile childrens presenter. Although he would come to be regarded as a main character, Martin Brown is not introduced until series 42 and was originally intended as a one-off character but was so well-received that a brief appearance by the character was added to the final episode of the series, before he was brought back as a regular in the fifth series.
