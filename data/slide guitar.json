Historian GÃ©rard Herzhaft stated, Black Ace is one of the few blues guitarists to have played in the purest Hawaiian style, that is, with the guitar flat on the knees.  Turner played a square-neck National style 2 Tri-cone metal body guitar and used a glass medicine bottle as a slide. Turner was also a good storyteller, which enabled him to host a radio program in Fort Worth called The Black Ace.  His career effectively ended when he entered military service in 1943. His album, I Am the Boss Card in Your Hand, contained Turners original 1930s recordings as well as new songs recorded in 1960. Turner was featured in a 1962 documentary film entitled The Blues.
