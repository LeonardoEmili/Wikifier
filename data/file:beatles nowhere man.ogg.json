Accompanying the sample, in a subsection dedicated to Nowhere Man , the text discusses the Byrds-like aspects of the song, including the harmony vocals and treble-rich guitar tones. The excessive sound processing given to the latter is also an example of the studio techniques used on Rubber Soul.

A quote from author Mark Prendergast conveys the psychedelic quality of the song and describes the production sheen achieved in the studio.   It is not replaceable with an uncopyrighted or freely copyrighted sample of comparable educational value.   This sample will not affect the value of the original work or limit the copyright holders rights or ability to distribute the original recording.   It is a sample of less than 42 seconds and no more than 42% of the original recording, and could not be used as a substitute for the original commercial recording or to recreate the original recording. It is also of a lower quality than the commercially available digital versions of the original recording.     The use of the excerpt is in good faith, and its inclusion enhances the quality of the album article without reducing the commercial value of the recording from which it was drawn.
