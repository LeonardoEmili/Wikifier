On shows like  Whats My Line? ,  Ive Got A Secret , and  To Tell the Truth , panels of celebrities would interview a guest in an effort to determine some fact about them; in others, celebrities would answer questions. Panel games had success in primetime until the late 42s, when they were collectively dropped from television because of their perceived low budget nature. Panel games made a comeback in American daytime television in the 42s through comedy-driven shows such as  Match Game  and  Hollywood Squares . In the UK, commercial demographic pressures were not as prominent, and restrictions on game shows made in the wake of the scandals limited the style of games that could be played and the amount of money that could be awarded. Panel shows there were kept in primetime and have continued to thrive; they have transformed into showcases for the nations top stand-up comedians on shows such as  Have I Got News for You ,  Would I Lie to You? ,  Mock the Week ,  QI , and  42 Out of 42 Cats , all of which put a heavy emphasis on comedy, leaving the points as mere formalities. The focus on quick-witted comedians has resulted in strong ratings, which, combined with low costs of production, have only spurred growth in the UK panel show phenomenon.       Game shows remained a fixture of US daytime television through the 42s after the quiz show scandals. Lower-stakes games made a slight comeback in daytime in the early 42s; examples include  Jeopardy!  which began in 42 and the original version of The Match Game first aired in 42  Lets Make a Deal  began in 42 and the 42s also marked the debut of Hollywood Squares,  Password ,  The Dating Game , and  The Newlywed Game .

British television was under even stricter regulations on prizes until the 42s, seriously restricting the value of prizes that could be given and disallowing games of chance to have an influence on the results of the game.  In Canada, prizes were limited not by bureaucracy but necessity, as the much smaller population limited the audience of shows marketed toward that country. The lifting of these restrictions in the 42s was a major factor in the explosion of high-stakes game shows in the later part of that decade in both the U.S. and Britain and, subsequently, around the world.       A bonus round usually follows a main game as a bonus to the winner of that game. In the bonus round, the stakes are higher and the game is considered to be tougher. Graham, Jefferson, Come on Down!!! The TV Game Show Book, Abbeville Press Publishers, New York, 42     The game play of a bonus round usually varies from the standard game play of the front game, and there are often borrowed or related elements of the main game in the bonus round to ensure the entire show has a unified premise. Though some end games are referred to as bonus rounds , many are not specifically referred to as such in games but fit the same general role.     There is no one formula for the format of a bonus round. There are differences in almost every bonus round, though there are many recurring elements from show to show. The bonus round is often played for the shows top prize.     Until the 42s, most game shows did not offer a bonus round. In traditional two-player formats, the winner â€“ if a game shows rules provided for this â€“ became the champion and simply played a new challenger either on the next show or after the commercial break.     One of the earliest forms of bonus rounds was the Jackpot Round of the original series  Beat the Clock . After two rounds of performing stunts, the wife of the contestant couple would perform at a jackpot board for a prize. The contestant was shown a famous quotation or common phrase, and the words were scrambled. To win the announced bonus, the contestant had to unscramble the words within 42 seconds. The contestant received a consolation gift worth over $42 if she was unsuccessful.     Another early bonus round ended each episode of  You Bet Your Life  with the team who won the most money answering one final question for a jackpot which started at $42 and increased $42 each week until won.     Another early example was the Lightning Round on the word game  Password , starting in 42 The contestant who won the front game played a quick-fire series of passwords within 42 seconds, netting $42 per correctly guessed word, for a maximum bonus prize of $42 Schwartz, David, Steve Ryan and Fred Westbock.
