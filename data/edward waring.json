He lamented the fact that in Great Britain mathematics was cultivated with less interest than on the continent, and clearly desired to be considered as highly as the great names in continental mathematics—there is no doubt that he was reading their work at a level never reached by any other eighteenth-century British mathematician. Most notably, at the end of chapter three of Meditationes Analyticae Waring presents some partial fluxional equations ; such equations are a mathematical instrument of great importance in the study of continuous bodies which was almost completely neglected in Britain before Warings researches. One of the most interesting results in Meditationes Analyticae is a test for the convergence of series generally attributed to dAlembert . The theory of convergence of series was not much advanced in the eighteenth century.     Warings work was known both in Britain and on the continent, but it is difficult to evaluate his impact on the development of mathematics.
