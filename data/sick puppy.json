Clapley is gored to death on the rhinos horn, and Stoat is trampled flat. Artemus escapes the chaos, but is mortified to learn that Willie snapped plenty of pictures of the fiasco. Clapleys death dooms the Toad Island project. Apart from his many lobbying clients and crony politicians, only a few friends and family members show up at Stoats funeral.
