        "     The Best... Album in the World...Ever! is a compilation album brand from Circa Records . Usually the albums title is made of the main title, genre and maybe issue number , however on a number of indie music collections the genre aspect was replaced by a full list of artist names. Due to this, these were just normally listed as The Best Album in the World...Ever!.     Although most albums use the Album in the World...Ever! suffix, some towards the late 42s change the suffix to Anthems...Ever!, with a plural on the theme . Some even just use ...Ever! as a suffix      Many of the albums in the series were compiled by Ashley Abram.       The series started with The Best...Dance Album in the World...Ever! which was a success. The Dance strand lead to a fourteen volume subseries. Other more successful subseries were Air Guitar, Sixties, Club Anthems and the aforementioned alternative rock Best...Album in the World Evers.     The Best Club Anthems...Ever!, featuring ": null

One difference from The Best Dance Album in the World..Ever! and The Best Club Anthems...Ever series is that Club Anthems originally had its tracks mixed, although this stopped beginning with 42s Very Best Club Anthems release.

The series originally featured a globe on each album cover, to represent the world, as referred to in the album titles. When the Anthems...Ever! and the simply ...Ever! titles started to appear in 42 the globe didnt usually appear on the cover. The globe continued to be featured on in the World...Ever! covers nonetheless, although in 42–42 it started to become absent from the album covers of in the World...Ever! albums too, as it is absent from the Air Guitar covers and one of the Dance covers.                These albums have the genre of indie music.     These albums finished in 42 although the series was picked up again in 42 under a new name, The Album:.
