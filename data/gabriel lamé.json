For example his work on the stability of vaults and on the design of suspension bridges led him to work on elasticity theory. In fact this was not a passing interest, for Lamé made substantial contributions to this topic. Another example is his work on the conduction of heat which led him to his theory of curvilinear coordinates.     Curvilinear coordinates proved a very powerful tool in Lamés hands. He used them to transform Laplaces equation into ellipsoidal coordinates and so separate the variables and solve the resulting equation.     His most significant contribution to engineering was to accurately define the stresses and capabilities of a press fit joint, such as that seen in a dowel pin in a housing.
