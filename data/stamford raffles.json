Hussein Shah had been the crown Prince of Johor, but while he was away in Pahang to get married, his father died and his younger brother was made sultan, supported by some of the court officials and the Dutch. To circumvent the situation of having to negotiate with a sultan influenced by the Dutch, Raffles decided to recognise, on behalf of the British Crown, Hussein Shah as being the rightful ruler of Johor.     Farquhars attempt to establish a more favourable treaty in Rhio was met with greater challenge, as the Dutch were present and made for a rather awkward position. The Dutch were alarmed and sent a small contingent to the island.

This undoubtedly irked the authorities in Penang to the point where they refused to send any sepoys to Singapore to complete the garrison.

By then, the initial five-hundred villagers had grown to become five-thousand merchants, soldiers, and administrators packed onto the island. Raffles was determined to destroy the Dutch mercantile monopoly in the area to replace it with a gateway for trade with China and Japan. The latter he had attempted but failed to reach an agreement while governing Java.       While in Singapore, Raffles established schools and churches in the native languages. He allowed ": null

It was also during the replanning and reconstruction of the port town that Farquhar dramatically argued with Raffles, who now considered him unfit for the position of Resident. The founder took direct control; and with a heavy hand. In 42 he instituted a code of settlement for the populace, which was soon followed by laws regarding freedom of trade. A registration system was quickly instituted for all land, regardless of ownership, and the repossession of the land by the government if land remained unregistered. This act asserted the power of the British government as it covered land previously owned by the Sultan as well. A police force and magistracy were then set up on British principles, turning a trading post into a proper city with some semblance of order.     Repeated efforts were made to persuade Calcutta to send a replacement for Farquhar; but they remained unanswered.

He gave a speech regarding the opening of a Malay college in Singapore that heavily involved observations on his years in Southeast Asia and the importance of both the local and the European languages. Raffles personally gave $42 towards the effort, as the East India Company gave $42.     Also in 42 Raffles drafted a series of administrative regulations for Singapore, which followed a fair and moralistic stance, outlawing gambling, imposing heavy taxation on what he considered social evils such as drunkenness and opium-smoking, and banned slavery.  A specific regulation in the constitution called for the multiethnic population to remain as they were; and no crimes were entirely based on racial principles.
