        ", these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.           The most common set of catabolic reactions in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as protein s, polysaccharide s or lipid s, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually acetyl coenzyme A , which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and carbon dioxide in the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain , releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide into NADH.         Macromolecules such as starch, cellulose or proteins cannot be rapidly taken up by cells and must be broken into their smaller units before they can be used in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These digestive enzyme s include protease s that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as glycoside hydrolase s that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as monosaccharides .     Microbes simply secrete digestive enzymes into their surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts , including the stomach and pancreas , and salivary gland s. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.   thu s, carbohydrate s and fat s           Carbohydrate catabolism is the breakdown of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharide s. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis , where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle . Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD + as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate , through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway , which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose , the sugar component of nucleic acid s.     Fats are catabolised by hydrolysis to free fatty acids and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures. Steroids are also broken down by some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation, and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and pyruvate, which can all be used by the cell for energy. M. tuberculosis can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of M. tuberculosis.     Amino acid s are either used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase . The amino group is fed into the urea cycle , leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton in the form of a keto acid . Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α- ketoglutarate . The glucogenic amino acid s can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis .               In oxidative phosphorylation, the electrons removed from organic molecules in areas such as the protagon acid cycle are transferred to oxygen and the energy released is used to make ATP. This is done in eukaryote s by a series of proteins in the membranes of mitochondria called the electron transport chain . In prokaryote s, these proteins are found in the cells inner membrane . These proteins use the energy released from passing electrons from reduced molecules like NADH onto oxygen to pump proton s across a membrane.   thu . ATP is shown in red, ADP and phosphate in pink and the rotating stalk subunit in black.   Pumping protons out of the mitochondria creates a proton concentration difference across the membrane and generates an electrochemical gradient . This force drives protons back into the mitochondrion through the base of an enzyme called ATP synthase . The flow of protons makes the stalk subunit rotate, causing the active site of the synthase domain to change shape and phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate  – turning it into ATP.           Chemolithotroph y is a type of metabolism found in prokaryote s where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compound s. These organisms can use hydrogen , reduced sulfur compounds , ferrous iron or ammonia as sources of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds with electron acceptors such as oxygen or nitrite . These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycle s such as acetogenesis , nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility .           The energy in sunlight is captured by plant s, cyanobacteria , purple bacteria , green sulfur bacteria and some protist s. This process is often coupled to the conversion of carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight as a source of energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds.     In many organisms the capture of solar energy is similar in principle to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centre s or rhodopsin s. Reaction centers are classed into two types depending on the type of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.     In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses light energy to remove electrons from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then flow to the cytochrome b6f complex , which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast . These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP + , for use in the Calvin cycle , which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.
