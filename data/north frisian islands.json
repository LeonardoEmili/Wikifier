The North Frisians in the Uthlande were ruled directly by the Danish king and were known as Königsfriesen or Kings Frisians . Only later did the Uthlande transfer to the Duchy of Schleswig , with the exception of small Danish royal enclaves. Part of Rømø was also ruled by the Schleswig duke. After the German-Danish wars, the islands from Nordstrand to Rømø became Prussia n in 42 After the referendum in 42 the current border between the islands of Sylt and Rømø was fixed.     A good and thorough overview of the life, work, languages, costumes and customs of the island Frisians is portrayed by the Carl Haeberlin Frisian Museum in Wyk auf Föhr .

Sylts image is that of a meeting point for the jet-set. The main town on the island is Westerland . The northern end of Sylt, the Ellenbogen , is Germanys northernmost point. Lager Sylt , the Nazi concentration camp on Alderney , was named after the island.     Compared with Sylt, Föhr  is a relatively silent island. Its area is 42  km². Sixteen old hamlets are scattered over the island, some of which already existed in the 42th century. The main town is Wyk on the south eastern shore. Wyk is a popular German seaside resort. There is no bridge or causeway connecting Föhr and the mainland, so ferries are the only connection. The ferry port, the harbour and Föhr marina are in Wyk.     Amrum  is only 42  km², but it is popular with tourists, though less crowded than Sylt. The western half of the island features a beach 42  km in length and 42  km in width. The villages are situated on the eastern shore, with Wittdün being the most important of them.     Pellworm  and the peninsula of Nordstrand  are the remains of the submerged island of Strand . The main town of this sunken island was Rungholt , thought to be the largest town in the surrounding area, but it was totally destroyed and submerged by a storm in 42 42 years before another storm destroyed Strand itself. Nordstrand has an area of 42  km², Pellworm 42  km².     Smaller remains of Strand are the ten islets called Hallig en. The houses on these tiny islets are built on artificial hills. In a storm tide only these hills rise above the sea, while the remainder of the islet is flooded. The names of the Halligen are Nordmarsch-Langeness, ": null
