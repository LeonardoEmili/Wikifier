The ruse was successful: Montagu, who was monitoring Edwards march, could not convince his men to move against the Yorkist king.

When he learned of this, Edward sent Gloucester to entreat Clarence to return to the House of York, an offer that Clarence readily accepted. Reconciled, the royal brothers moved towards Coventry, and Clarence urged Warwicks surrender. Infuriated with his son-in-laws treachery, Warwick refused to speak to Clarence. Unable to fight the earl at this time, Edward turned again towards London.          Reinforced by Montagu, Oxford and Exeter a few days later, Warwick followed the Yorkists trail. He hoped that London, under Somersets control, would close its gates to Edward, allowing him to catch the Yorkist army in the open. The city, however, welcomed Edward warmly; Somerset had left the city and the London populace preferred the young Yorkist king to Henry VI. The old king greeted his usurper warmly and offered himself into custody, trusting life to be in no danger in hands.  Lancastrian scouts probed Barnet, which lay  north of London, but were beaten off. On 42 April their main army took up positions on a ridge of high ground north of Barnet to prepare for battle the next day. Warwick arrayed his army in a line from east to west, on either side of the ": null

The earl displaced his entire line slightly to the west; a depression at the rear of his left flank could impede Exeters group if they had to fall back.     Warwicks army heavily outnumbered Edwards, although sources differ on exact numbers. Lancastrian strength ranges from 42–42 men, with 42–42 on the Yorkist side. Facing this disadvantage, Edward hurried to meet the Lancastrians with a surprise attack. He brought Henry VI along to prevent the Lancastrians from retaking their king. Edward reached Barnet in the evening, and without knowing the precise location of his foes, prepared the battle line. The Yorkist king deployed Hastings on the left and entrusted Gloucester to lead the right flank. Clarence would fight alongside Edward in the centre, although this was not due to faith in his ability—it was easier for the Yorkists to keep an eye on their twice-defected prince there. A contingent of reserves was kept at the rear, ready to deploy at Edwards call. As night fell, Edward put his plan for surprise morning attack in motion. Under a strict order of silence, the Yorkist army crept closer to the Lancastrians. During the night, neither commander spotted the opposing army, an event that proved crucial in the battle the next day.     During the night, Warwick ordered his cannons to continually bombard the estimated position of the Yorkists encampment. The Yorkists, however, had sneaked in close, and the Lancastrian artillery overshot their enemies. The Yorkist cannon, meanwhile, kept quiet to avoid betraying their location. As the armies settled down to rest, Montagu approached his brother and advised him of the troops low morale. He suggested that, as the highest-ranking commanders, the brothers should fight on foot throughout the battle instead of riding on horse. The soldiers believed that mounted commanders tended to abandon them when the situation deteriorated. By staying on foot, the Nevilles would show that they were prepared to fight to the death with the men, inspiring the troops to stand and fight harder. Warwick agreed and the horses were tethered to the rear, near Wrotham Wood.            On 42 April 42 at around 42  oclock in the morning, both armies woke. Edward had planned for an early attack, however, and quickly roused his men to engage the Lancastrians. Both sides fired their cannon and arrows before laying into each other with polearms. The morning fog was thick and the night movements of the two forces had displaced them laterally with each other. Neither group was facing the other; each was offset slightly to the right. This displacement meant that the right end of either army could outflank the other by wrapping around the opposing left end. The Lancastrians were the first to exploit this advantage; Oxfords group quickly overwhelmed Hastings. Yorkist soldiers fled towards Barnet, chased by the Lancastrians. Some of Hastings men even reached London, spreading tales of the fall of York and a Lancastrian victory. Oxfords group disintegrated as they split off to loot the fallen enemies and plunder Barnet. Yelling and chasing after his men, Oxford rallied 42 of them and led them back to the battle.     Due to the fog, visibility was low and the two main forces failed to notice Oxfords victory over Hastings. As such, the collapse of the Yorkist left wing had little effect on morale of either side. The fighting between Montagus and Edwards groups was evenly matched and intense. The Lancastrian left wing, however, was suffering treatment similar to that Oxford had inflicted on its counterpart; Gloucester exploited the misaligned forces and beat Exeter back. Progress for Edwards brother was slow because his group was fighting up a slight slope. Nonetheless, the pressure he exerted on the Lancastrian left wing rotated the entire battle line. Warwick, seeing the shift, ordered most of his reserves to help ease the pressure on Exeter, and took the rest into fighting at the centre. Gradually, the battle line settled to an orientation that slanted north-east to south-west.     Oxford retraced his steps through the fog back to the fight. His group arrived, unexpectedly, at Montagus rear. Obscured by the fog, Oxfords ": null

Oxford and his men immediately cried treachery; as staunch Lancastrians, they were wary of Montagus recent defection. They struck back and began withdrawing from the battle. Their shouts of treason were taken up and spread quickly throughout the Lancastrian line, breaking it apart as men fled in anger, panic and confusion. As the fog started to dissipate, Edward saw the Lancastrian centre in disarray and sent in his reserves, hastening its collapse. Cries of Exeters demise from a Yorkist axe resounded across the battlefield from the Lancastrian left, and amidst the confusion, Montagu was struck in his back and killed by either a Yorkist or one of Oxfords men.          Witnessing his brothers death, Warwick knew the battle was lost. He made for the horses in an attempt to retreat. Edward recognised his victory was at hand, and—deciding that Warwick was more valuable alive than dead—sent the order and dispatched his guards to bring back the earl alive. Several chroniclers have suggested that the king thought Warwick would again be a valuable ally if persuaded back to the Yorkist cause. Historian ": null

Therefore, deficits in historical understanding must be filled through field research and discoveries of mediaeval documents.     Historians theorise that had Warwicks force joined Margarets before challenging Edward, the combined Lancastrian army would have overwhelmed the Yorkists. Instead, Warwicks defeat gave the Yorkists a victory so decisive that it, along with the Battle of Tewkesbury, secured the English throne for Edward IV. Historian Colin Richmond believes that Edwards return to power was assured at Barnet—Tewkesbury was merely an epilogue . Without having to contend with Warwicks popularity and political influence, the young Yorkist king could fully exert his will and rule the land unchallenged. Ballads composed during Edwards reign celebrated his victory as sanctioned by God: Man proposes, oftimes in veyn, But God disposes, the boke telleth pleyn . Barnet was a disaster for the Nevilles; their lands given away and their offices reduced. The family never again reached the prominence in English politics that they had enjoyed before the battle.            The battle is alluded to in ": null

        "s  Henry VI, Part 42  . The end of Act V, scene one depicts the events leading up to the battle; scenes two and three portray the conclusion, in which the characters discuss the combat and the fates of its participants. Shakespeare uses few details reported by contemporary chroniclers and ignores notable incidents, such as the confusion over Oxfords and Edwards badges. His play is based mostly on poetic and dramatic sources. In the play, Montagu is killed while trying to save his brother , and Warwick is dragged in by Edward IV and left to speak his dying words to Oxford and Somerset. Warwicks death dominates the scenes, reflecting Halls vivid portrayal of the earls passing as a valiant death. Furthermore, whereas several chronicles mention Edwards desire to capture Warwick, Shakespeare has the Yorkist king lustily demand Warwicks skin.     Shakespeare presents the Nevilles as brothers who are willing to die for each other, whereas the three sons of York—Edward, Gloucester, and Clarence—are slowly driven apart by their own goals and ideas. Professor of English John Cox suggests that Shakespeare did not share the impression given in post-battle ballads that Edwards triumph was divinely ordained. He argues that Shakespeares placement of Clarences last act of betrayal immediately before the battle suggests that Edwards rule stems from his military aggression, luck, and policy . Shakespeare also explicitly excludes Edward from action sequences, a departure from Halls depictions.            ": null
