The relationship of Matthew to this wider world of Judaism remains a subject of study and contention, the principal question being to what extent, if any, Matthews community had cut itself off from its Jewish roots. Certainly there was conflict between Matthews group and other Jewish groups, and it is generally agreed that the root of the conflict was the Matthew communitys belief in Jesus as the Messiah and authoritative interpreter of the law, as one risen from the dead and uniquely endowed with divine authority.     The author of Matthew wrote for a community of Greek-speaking Jewish Christians located probably in Syria . Unlike Mark, Matthew never bothers to explain Jewish customs, since his intended audience was a Jewish one; unlike Luke, who traces Jesus ancestry back to Adam, father of the human race, he traces it only to Abraham, father of the Jews; of his three presumed sources only M , the material from his own community, refers to a church , an organised group with rules for keeping order; and the content of M suggests that this community was strict in keeping the Jewish law, holding that they must exceed the scribes and the Pharisees in righteousness . Writing from within a Jewish-Christian community growing increasingly distant from other Jews and becoming increasingly Gentile in its membership and outlook, Matthew put down in his gospel his vision of an assembly or church in which both Jew and Gentile would flourish together .                Matthew, alone among the gospels, alternates five blocks of narrative with five of discourse, marking each off with the phrase When Jesus had finished...  .

Early understandings of this nature grew as the gospels were being written. Before the gospels, that understanding was focused on the revelation of Jesus as God in his resurrection, but the gospels reflect a broadened focus extended backwards in time. The gospel of Mark recounts prior revelations in Jesus lifetime on earth, at his baptism and transfiguration. Matthew and Luke go back further still, showing Jesus as the Son of God from his birth.
