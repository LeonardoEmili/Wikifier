Definition of any normal algorithm consists of two parts: the definition of the alphabet algorithm , and the definition of its scheme. Scheme normal algorithm is a finite ordered set of so-called substitution formulas, each of which can be simple or final. A simple formula substitutions are called words such as L\\to D , where L and D – are two arbitrary words in the alphabet of the algorithm . Similarly, the final substitution formulas are called words of the form L\\to\\cdot D , where L and D – are two arbitrary words in the alphabet of the algorithm. This assumes that the auxiliary characters \\to and \\to\\cdot do not belong to the alphabet of the algorithm .     An example of a normal algorithm scheme in five-letter alphabet |abc can serve the following scheme:     : \\left\\": null
