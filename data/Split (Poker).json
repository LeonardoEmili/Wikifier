If there is more than one denomination of chip in the pot, the largest value chip is done first, and then progressively smaller value chips. If there is an odd number of larger chips, smaller chips from the pot can be used to equalize stacks or make change as necessary. Pots are always split down to the lowest denomination of chip used in the game. Three-way ties or further splits can also be done this way.     After fully dividing a pot, there may be a single odd lowest-denomination chip remaining . Odd chips can be awarded in several ways, agreed upon before the beginning of the game. The following rules are common:     If playing a high-low split game and dividing a pot between the high and low hands, always award the odd chip to the high hand.

When this happens, an exception to the odd chip rules above can be made: if the high hand wins its half of the pot alone, and the low half is going to be quartered, the odd chip from the first split should be placed in the low half, rather than being awarded to the high hand.
