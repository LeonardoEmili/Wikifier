When the final payment on the farm was owed, Sam May refused to cover his brother-in-laws debts, as he often did, possibly at Abby Mays suggestion.  The experiment failed, the Alcotts had to leave Fruitlands.     The members of the Alcott family were not happy with their Fruitlands experience. At one point, Abby May threatened that she and their daughters would move elsewhere, leaving Bronson behind.  Louisa May Alcott, who was ten years old at the time, later wrote of the experience in Transcendental Wild Oats : The band of brothers began by spading garden and field; but a few days of it lessened their ardor amazingly.

In 1880 the school moved to the Hillside Chapel, a building next to the house, where he held conversations and, over the course of successive summers, as he entered his eighties, invited others to give lectures on themes in philosophy, religion and letters. The school, considered one of the first formal adult education centers in America, was also attended by foreign scholars. It continued for nine years.     In April 1882, Alcotts friend and benefactor Ralph Waldo Emerson was sick and bedridden. After visiting him, Alcott wrote, Concord will be shorn of its human splendor when he withdraws behind the cloud. Emerson died the next day.

When that student observed an infraction, he or she reported it to the rest of the class and, as a whole, they deliberated on punishment.  At times, Alcott offered his own hand for an offending student to strike, saying that any failing was the teachers responsibility. The shame and guilt this method induced, he believed, was far superior to the fear instilled by corporal punishment; when he used physical correction he required that the students be unanimously in support of its application, even including the student to be punished.     The most detailed discussion of his theories on education is in an essay, Observations on the Principles and Methods of Infant Instruction . Alcott believed that early education must draw out unpremeditated thoughts and feelings of the child and emphasized that infancy should primarily focus on enjoyment.  He noted that learning was not about the acquisition of facts but the development of a reflective state of mind.      Alcotts ideas as an educator were controversial. Writer ": null

Many of Alcotts educational principles are still used in classrooms today, including teach by encouragement , art education, music education, acting exercises, learning through experience, risk-taking in the classroom, tolerance in schools, physical education/recess, and early childhood education. The teachings of William Ellery Channing a few years earlier had also laid the groundwork for the work of most of the Concord Transcendentalists.     The Concord School of Philosophy, which closed following Alcotts death in 1888, was reopened almost 90 years later in the 1970s. It has continued functioning with a Summer Conversational Series in its original building at Orchard House, now run by the Louisa May Alcott Memorial Association.

His Orphic Sayings , published in The Dial, became famous for their hilarity as dense, pretentious, and meaningless.
