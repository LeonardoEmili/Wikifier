Stratified sampling is not useful when the population cannot be exhaustively partitioned into disjoint subgroups.   It would be a misapplication of the technique to make subgroups sample sizes proportional to the amount of data available from the subgroups, rather than scaling sample sizes to subgroup sizes . Data representing each subgroup are taken to be of equal importance if suspected variation among them warrants stratified sampling. If subgroup variances differ significantly and the data needs to be stratified by variance, it is not possible to simultaneously make each subgroup sample size proportional to subgroup size within the total population.
