Another 42 French troops were sent across the Main at Aschaffenburg, behind the Allies; Noailles had high hopes of destroying their entire army.      The French presence in Dettingen took the Allies by surprise and the danger of their situation quickly became apparent when they saw the detachment moving into their rear. General Ilton ordered the British and Hanoverian Foot Guards back to Aschaffenburg, while the remainder spent the next six hours forming up in four lines to attack the French position.

De Vallières artillery had to cease fire for fear of hitting their own troops and the British infantry of the fourth line held their ground. A Hanoverian artillery battery began firing at close range into the French infantry, while an Austrian brigade took them in the flank. After three hours of fighting, the French were forced back across the river, most of their casualties occurring when one of the bridges collapsed.     Once across the river on the left bank of the Main, the French allowed the Allies to continue their march towards Hanau; it has been suggested they could have exploited their victory but in reality they were in no shape to attempt an river crossing. As agreed prior to the battle, their wounded were left behind for the French to look after. Noailles followed close behind and the Allied army took up winter quarters in Hanover at the end of October.
