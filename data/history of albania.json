        ", Albanias rulers implemented new elements of the Stalinist economic system. In 1949, Albania adopted the basic elements of the Soviet fiscal system, under which state enterprises paid direct contributions to the treasury from their profits and kept only a share authorized for self-financed investments and other purposes. In 1951, the Albanian government launched its first five-year plan, which emphasized exploiting the countrys oil, chromite, copper, nickel, asphalt, and coal resources; expanding electricity production and the power grid; increasing agricultural output; and improving transportation. The government began a program of rapid industrialization after the APLs Second Party Congress and a campaign of forced collectivization of farmland in 1955. At the time, private farms still produced about 87% of Albanias agricultural output, but by 1960 the same percentage came from collective or state farms.     Stalin died in March 1953, and apparently fearing that the Soviet rulers demise might encourage rivals within the Albanian partys ranks, neither Hoxha nor Shehu risked traveling to ": null
