In Quines set-theoretical writing, the phrase ultimate class is often used instead of the phrase proper class emphasising that in the systems he considers, certain classes cannot be members, and are thus the final term in any membership chain to which they belong.     Outside set theory, the word class is sometimes used synonymously with set . This usage dates from a historical period where classes and sets were not distinguished as they are in modern set-theoretic terminology. Many discussions of classes in the 19th century and earlier are really referring to sets, or perhaps rather take place without considering that certain classes can fail to be sets.
