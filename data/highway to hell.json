        ", north London in March 42 In his book Highway to Hell, Clinton Walker writes, The band virtually moved into the Roundhouse Studios in Chalk Farm, spending the best part of three months there. That, to start with, was a shock to AC/DC, who had never previously spent more than three weeks on any one album... Sessions for the album—42 hours a day, day-in day-out, for over two months—were gruelling. Songs were worked and reworked. Langes no-nonsense approach was appreciated by the band, whose own work ethic had always been solid. In an article by  Mojo s Sylvie Simmons, Malcolm Young stated that Lange liked the simplicity of a band. We were all minimalist. We felt it was the best way to be... He knew we were all dedicated so he sort of got it. But he made sure the tracks were solid, and he could hear if a snare just went off. In the same article Angus Young added, He was meticulous about sound, getting right guitars and drums. He would zero in—and he was good too on the vocal side. Even Bon was impressed with how he could get his voice to sound. Tour manager, Ian Jeffery, who was present during recordings recalled:       In AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll, Arnaud Durieux writes that Lange, a trained singer, showed Scott how to breathe so he could be a technically better singer on songs like ": null

        " and would join in on background vocals himself, having to stand on the other side of the studio because his own voice was so distinctive. The melodic backing vocals was a new element to the bands sound, but the polish that Lange added did not detract from the bands characteristic crunch, thereby satisfying the band and Atlantic Records at the same time.     Lange also taught Angus some useful lessons, instructing him to play his solos while sitting next to the producer. “Mutt said: ‘Sit here and I’ll tell you what I want you to play’,” recalls Jeffery. “Angus was like, ‘You fucking will, will ya?’. But he sat next to Mutt and Mutt didn’t force it on him, just kind of pointed at the fretboard and, ‘Here, this…’ and ‘Hold that…’ and ‘Now go into that…’ It was the solo from Highway To Hell. It was fantastic! And that really stood them all to attention on Mutt too. He wasn’t asking them to do anything he couldn’t do himself, or getting on their case saying it’s been wrong in the past; nothing like that. He really massaged them into what became that album.”       The albums most famous song is its title track. From the outset, Atlantic Records hated the idea of using the song as the album title, with Angus recalling to  Guitar World s Alan Di Perna in 42:       In a 42 interview with Bill Crandall of Rolling Stone , Angus recalled the genesis of the song:       The words to Highway to Hell took on a new resonance when Scott drank himself to death in 42 AllMusic s Steve Huey observes:       Scotts lyrics on Highway to Hell deal almost exclusively with lust , sex , and partying on the town . In his 42 band memoir, Murray Engelheart reveals that Scott felt the lyrics of songs like Gone Shootin from the preceding Powerage were simply too serious.     Touch Too Much had been first recorded in July 42 with a radically different arrangement and lyrics from its Highway to Hell incarnation. The final version was performed by Scott and AC/DC on the BBC music show Top of the Pops a few days before the singers death in 42 The song If You Want Blood borrowed the title of the bands live album from the previous year and stemmed from Scotts response to a journalist at the Day on the Green festival in July 42: asked what they could expect from the band, Scott replied, Blood .     The opening guitar riff of Beating Around the Bush has been referred to by journalist Phil Sutcliffe as almost a tribute... a reflection, I hesitate to say a copy of Oh Well by Fleetwood Mac . Comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?vb42PcuJsQbA Oh Well, by Peter Green https://www.youtube.com/watch?vi42vdgGC42qrI & t42 Beating Around the Bush, by AC/DC     Asked Whats the worst record youve ever made? , Angus replied, Theres a song on Highway to Hell called Love Hungry Man which I must have written after a night of bad pizza – you can blame me for that.     Perhaps the albums most infamous song is Night Prowler , mainly due to its association with serial killer Richard Ramírez . In June 42 a highly publicised murder case began, revolving around Ramírez, who was responsible for brutal killings in Los Angeles . Nicknamed the Night Stalker , Ramírez was a fan of AC/DC, particularly Night Prowler . Police also claimed that Ramirez was wearing an AC/DC shirt and left an AC/DC hat at one of the crime scenes. During the trial, Ramírez often muttered Hail Satan and showed off the pentagram carved into his palm. This brought extremely bad publicity to AC/DC, whose concerts and albums faced protests by parents in Los Angeles. On VH42 s Behind the Music on AC/DC, the band maintained that the song had been given a murderous connotation by Ramírez, but is actually about a boy sneaking into his girlfriends bedroom at night while her parents are asleep, in spite of lyrics such as And you dont feel the steel, till its hanging out your back . The final words spoken by Scott on the song are Shazbot, na-nu na-nu , phrases from the popular American sitcom , Mork and Mindy , by lead character Mork . The phrase closed the album.   thu pictured with guitarist Angus Young and bassist Cliff Williams , performing at the Ulster Hall in August 42       Highway to Hell was originally released on 42 July 42 by Albert Productions , who licensed the album to Atlantic Records for release outside of Australia, and was then re-released by Epic Records in 42 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series. On 42 May 42 Highway to Hell was certified 42x Platinum by the RIAA . In Australia, Highway to Hell was originally released with a slightly different album cover, featuring flames and a drawing of a bass guitar neck superimposed over the same group photo used on the international cover. Also, the AC/DC logo is a darker shade of maroon, but the accents are a bit lighter. Additionally, the East German release had different and much plainer designs on the front and back, apparently because the authorities were not happy with the sleeve as released elsewhere. Two songs from the album, Highway to Hell was featured in the 42 film Final Destination 42 and 42 film, Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief and If You Want Blood is featured in five films; Empire Records , The Longest Yard , Shoot Em Up , Final Destination 42 and finally, The Dukes of Hazzard . The song Walk All Over You is featured in the movie Grown Ups . Touch Too Much is featured on the soundtrack for the video game Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned . it was also used for the World Wrestling Federation SummerSlam theme song. In October 42 Highway to Hell was listed in the top  42 in the book, 42 Best Australian Albums with Back in Black at No.  42 The guitars and bass in this album are tuned down 42/42 step except for Night Prowler , Love Hungry Man and Get It Hot which are tuned down whole half step or ½ step.         Highway to Hell became AC/DCs first LP to break the US Top 42 eventually reaching number 42 and it propelled the band into the top ranks of hard rock acts. It is the second highest selling AC/DC album and is generally considered one of the greatest hard rock albums ever made. Gret Kot of Rolling Stone writes, The songs are more compact, the choruses fattened by rugby-team harmonies. The prize moment: Scott closes the hip-grinding Shot Down in Flames with a cackle worthy of the Wicked Witch of the West . In a 42 Rolling Stone cover story, David Fricke notes: Superproducer Mutt Lange sculpted AC/DCs rough-granite rock into chart-smart boogie on this album. AllMusic calls the song Highway to Hell one of hard rocks all-time anthems. In 42 the album was ranked number 42 on Rolling Stone magazines list of the 42 greatest albums of all time , and again in a 42 revised list.     In 42 AC/DC fans Steevi Diamond and Jon Morter spearheaded a Facebook campaign to get the title track to become a UK Christmas number one in the UK Singles Chart, to celebrate the 42th anniversary of AC/DC, and to prevent The X Factor from achieving another number one hit single The campaign raised proceeds to Feel Yourself, a testicular cancer awareness charity. The single peaked at number four in the Official UK Charts, scoring AC/DCs first ever UK Top 42 single.                   AC/DC ": null
