This phenomenon was not uncommon in the pre-VCR era. In the effort to rush a book onto the shelves to coincide with the airing of a new TV series, the commissioned novelist often had only limited source material to work from, such as a series writers bible , some production photos and perhaps a pilot script. Men Into Space was followed, seven years later, by two original novels based on  The Time Tunnel  , and three based on  Land of the Giants  .
