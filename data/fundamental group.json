Start with a space , and some point in it, and all the loops both starting and ending at this point — paths that start at this point, wander around and eventually return to the starting point. Two loops can be combined together in an obvious way: travel along the first loop, then along the second.   Two loops are considered equivalent if one can be deformed into the other without breaking. The set of all such loops with this method of combining and this equivalence between them is the fundamental group for that particular space.            Throughout this article, X is a topological space. A typical example is a surface such as the one depicted at the right. Moreover, x_0 is a point in X called the base-point. The idea of the definition of the homotopy group is to measure how many curves on X can be deformed into each other. The precise definition depends on the notion of the homotopy of loops, which is explained first.         Given a topological space X, a  loop based at x_0  is defined to be a ": null

The purpose of considering the equivalence classes of loops up to homotopy, as opposed to the set of all loops  is that the latter, while being useful for various purposes, is a rather big and unwieldy object. By contrast the above quotient has, in many cases, a manageable and computable size.          By the above definition, \\pi_1 is just a set. It becomes a group  using the concatenation of loops. More precisely, given two loops \\gamma_0, \\gamma_1, their product is defined as the loop   : \\begin   \\gamma_0 \\cdot \\gamma_1 : & \\to X \\\\   & \\begin   \\gamma_0 & 0 \\leq t \\leq \\tfrac \\\\   \\gamma_1 & \\tfrac \\leq t \\leq 1.   \\end   \\end   Thus the loop \\gamma_0 \\cdot \\gamma_1 first follows the loop \\gamma_0 with twice the speed and then follows \\gamma_1 with twice the speed .
