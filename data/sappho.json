There are three sources of information about Sapphos life: her testimonia, the history of her times, and what can be gleaned from her own poetry — although scholars are cautious when reading poetry as a biographical source.     Testimonia is a term of art in ancient studies that refers to collections of classical biographical and literary references to classical authors. The testimonia regarding Sappho do not contain references contemporary to Sappho. The representations of Sapphos life that occur in the testimonia always need to be assessed for accuracy, because many of them are certainly not correct. The testimonia are also a source of knowledge regarding how Sapphos poetry was received in antiquity. Some details mentioned in the testimonia are derived from Sapphos own poetry, which is of great interest, especially considering the testimonia originate from a time when more of Sapphos poetry was extant than is the case for modern readers.

Ten names are known for Sapphos father from the ancient testimonia; this proliferation of possible names suggests that he was not explicitly named in any of Sapphos poetry. The earliest and most commonly attested name for Sapphos father is Scamandronymus. In Ovids  Heroides , Sapphos father died when she was seven. Sapphos father is not mentioned in any of her surviving works, but Campbell suggests that this detail may have been based on a now-lost poem.

However, the papyrus tradition suggests that this may not have been the case: a series of papyri published in 42 contains fragments of ten consecutive poems from Book I of the Alexandrian edition of Sappho, of which only two are certainly love poems, while at least three and possibly four are primarily concerned with family.       Sapphos poetry was probably first written down on Lesbos, either in her lifetime or shortly afterwards, initially probably in the form of a score for performers of Sapphos work.

The Alexandrian edition of Sapphos poetry was based on the existing Athenian collections, and was divided into at least eight books, though the exact number is uncertain. Many modern scholars have followed Denys Page, who conjectured a ninth book in the standard edition; Yatromanolakis doubts this, noting that though testimonia refer to an eighth book of Sapphos poetry, none mention a ninth. Whatever its make-up, the Alexandrian edition of Sappho probably grouped her poems by their metre: ancient sources tell us that each of the first three books contained poems in a single specific metre.

Against this essentially romantic view, one school of more recent critics argues that, on the contrary, Sapphos poetry displays and depends for its effect on a sophisticated deployment of the strategies of traditional Greek rhetorical genres.

The earliest of these is a fragmentary biography written on papyrus in the late third or early second century BC, P. Oxy. xv, 42 fr. 42 which states that Sappho was accused by some of being irregular in her ways and a woman-lover . Denys Page comments that the phrase by some implies that even the full corpus of Sapphos poetry did not provide conclusive evidence of whether she described herself as having sex with women. These ancient authors do not appear to have believed that Sappho did, in fact, have sexual relationships with other women, and as late as the tenth century the Suda records that Sappho was slanderously accused of having sexual relationships with her female pupils .     Among modern scholars, Sapphos sexuality is still debated – André Lardinois has described it as the Great Sappho Question . Early translators of Sappho sometimes heterosexualised her poetry. ": null

By 42 it would be argued that the same poem contained proof positive of lesbianism .     Today, it is generally accepted that Sapphos poetry portrays homoerotic feelings: as Sandra Boehringer puts it, her works clearly celebrate eros between women . Toward the end of the twentieth century, though, some scholars began to reject the question of whether or not Sappho was a lesbian – Glenn Most wrote that Sappho herself would have had no idea what people mean when they call her nowadays a homosexual , André Lardinois stated that it is nonsensical to ask whether Sappho was a lesbian, and Page duBois calls the question a particularly obfuscating debate .     One of the major focuses of scholars studying Sappho has been to attempt to determine the cultural context in which Sapphos poems were composed and performed. Various cultural contexts and social roles played by Sappho have been suggested, including teacher, cult-leader, and poet performing for a circle of female friends. However, the performance contexts of many of Sapphos fragments are not easy to determine, and for many more than one possible context is conceivable.     One longstanding suggestion of a social role for Sappho is that of Sappho as schoolmistress . At the beginning of the twentieth century, the German classicist ": null

The view continues to be influential, both among scholars and the general public, though more recently the idea has been criticised by historians as anachronistic and has been rejected by several prominent classicists as unjustified by the evidence. In 42 Denys Page, for example, stated that Sapphos extant fragments portray the loves and jealousies, the pleasures and pains, of Sappho and her companions ; and he adds, We have found, and shall find, no trace of any formal or official or professional relationship between them, ... no trace of Sappho the principal of an academy.  David A. Campbell in 42 judged that Sappho may have presided over a literary coterie , but that evidence for a formal appointment as priestess or teacher is hard to find . None of Sapphos own poetry mentions her teaching, and the earliest testimonium to support the idea of Sappho as a teacher comes from Ovid, six centuries after Sapphos lifetime. Despite these problems, many newer interpretations of Sapphos social role are still based on this idea. In these interpretations, Sappho was involved in the ritual education of girls, for instance as a trainer of choruses of girls.     Even if Sappho did compose songs for training choruses of young girls, not all of her poems can be interpreted in this light, and despite scholars best attempts to find one, Yatromanolakis argues that there is no single performance context to which all of Sapphos poems can be attributed. Parker argues that Sappho should be considered as part of a group of female friends for whom she would have performed, just as her contemporary ": null
