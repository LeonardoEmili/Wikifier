Since their games were text-based, patrons of bookstores were drawn to the Infocom games as they were already interested in reading. Unlike most computer software, Infocom titles were distributed under a no-returns policy, which allowed them to make money from a single game for a longer period of time.     Next, Infocom titles featured strong storytelling and rich descriptions, eschewing the inherent restrictions of graphic displays and allowing users to use their own imaginations for the lavish and exotic locations the games described.  Infocoms puzzles were unique in that they were usually tightly integrated into the storyline, and rarely did gamers feel like they were being made to jump through one arbitrary hoop after another, as was the case in many of the competitors games. The puzzles were generally logical but also required close attention to the clues and hints given in the story, causing many gamers to keep copious notes as they went along.

Although Infocom started out with Zork, and although the Zork world was the centerpiece of their product line throughout the Zork and Enchanter series, the company quickly branched out into a wide variety of story lines: fantasy, science-fiction, mystery, horror, historical adventure, childrens stories, and others that defied easy categorization. In an attempt to reach out to female customers, Infocom also produced  Plundered Hearts , which cast the gamer in the role of the heroine of a swashbuckling adventure on the high seas, and which required the heroine to use more feminine tactics to win the game, since hacking-and-slashing was not a very ladylike way to behave. And to compete with the  Leisure Suit Larry  style games that were also appearing, Infocom also came out with  Leather Goddesses of Phobos  in 1986, which featured tame , suggestive , and lewd playing modes. It included among its feelies a scratch-and-sniff card with six odors that corresponded to cues given to the player during the game.

To prevent the mere questions from giving away too much information about the game, a certain number of misleading fake questions were included in every InvisiClues book. Answers to these questions would start by giving misleading or impossible to carry out answers, before the final answer revealed that the question was a fake . The InvisiClues books were regularly ranked in near the top of best seller lists for computer books.     In the Solid Gold line of re-releases, InvisiClues were integrated into the game. By typing HINT twice the player would open up a screen of possible topics where they could then reveal one hint at a time for each puzzle, just like the books.       Infocom also released a small number of interactive fiction paperbacks , which were based on the games and featured the ability to choose a different path through the story. Similar to the  Choose Your Own Adventure  series, every couple of pages the book would give the reader the chance to make a choice, such as which direction they wanted to go or how they wanted to respond to another character. The reader would then choose one of the given answers and turn to the appropriate page. These books, however, never did sell particularly well, and quickly disappeared from the bookshelves.

Businesses were moving en masse to the IBM PC platform by that time, so portability was no longer a significant differentiator. Infocom had sunk much of the money from games sales into Cornerstone; this, in addition to a slump in computer game sales, left the company in a very precarious financial position.

Zork especially benefited; its sales rose for years after its initial release in 1980. To Infocoms surprise it sold almost 100,000 copies of the game in 1983, and the figure rose by more than 50% in 1984.  Activision preferred to market Infocoms games the way they marketed their other titles: replacing older titles with newer ones. While this made sense for the graphically intensive games that made up the rest of Activisions catalog, since Infocom games were text based, it didnt make sense – the newer games didnt have improved text. This marketing approach cut off potential revenue for numerous Infocom titles that had consistently brought in money for several years.   Davis required the struggling developer to produce eight titles a year. Infocom had traditionally produced about four games per year with more staff than they had post-merger.   Davis pushed Infocom to release more graphical games, but the one they did release,  Fooblitzky , bombed. This was, in part, due to Infocoms long-standing rule of maximum portability; a game that could display graphics on a number of different systems couldnt take advantage of the strengths of any of them.   The cost of acquisition was amortized by deducting it from Infocoms operating revenue during the next several years.       By 1988, rumors spread of disputes between Activision and Infocom.
