Camus travelled to Algeria to negotiate a truce between both belligerents but was met with distrust by all parties. His confrontation with an Algerian nationalist during his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize caused a sensation. When confronted with the dilemma of choosing between his mother and justice, his response was: I have always condemned terrorism, and I must condemn a terrorism that works blindly in the streets of Algiers and one day might strike at my mother and family. I believe in justice, but I will defend my mother before justice.  Camuss critics claimed it reactionary and a result of a colonialist attitude.

He lived in very poor conditions as a child but was a citizen of France and as such was entitled to citizens rights; the Arab and Berber majority of the country were not.     Camus was a vocal advocate of the new Mediterranean Culture . This was a term he used to describe his vision of embracing the multi-ethnicity of the Algerian people, in opposition to Latiny , a popular pro-fascist and antisemitic ideology among other  Pieds-Noirs —or French or Europeans born in Algeria. For Camus, this vision encapsulated the Hellenic humanism which survived among ordinary people around the Mediterranean Sea.

His belief that the absurd—life being void of meaning, or mans inability to know that meaning if it were to exist—was something that man should embrace. His anti-Christianity, his commitment to individual moral freedom and responsibility are only a few of the similarities with other existential writers.

Camus viewed the question of suicide as arising naturally as a solution to the absurdity of life.       Many existentialist writers have addressed the Absurd, each with their own interpretation of what it is and what makes it important. Kierkegaard explains that the absurdity of religious truths prevents us from reaching God rationally. Sartre recognizes the absurdity of individual experience. Camuss thoughts on the Absurd begins with his first cycle of books and the literary essay Le Mythe de Sisyphe, his major work on the subject. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life in LÉtranger. He also wrote a play about ": null

        ", a Roman Emperor, pursuing an absurd logic, which was not performed until 1945. His early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays, LEnvers et lendroit  in 1937. Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, Noces , in 1938 and The Wrong Side and the Right Side. In these essays, Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd. Aspects of the notion of the Absurd can be found in The Plague.     Camus follows Sartres definition of the Absurd: That which is meaningless. Thus mans existence is absurd because his contingency finds no external justification . The Absurd is created because man, who is placed in an unintelligent universe, realises that human values are not founded on a solid external component; or as Camus himself explains, the Absurd is the result of the confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.  Even though absurdity is inescapable, Camus does not drift towards nihilism. But the realization of absurdity leads to the question: Why should someone continue to live? Suicide is an option that Camus firmly dismisses as the renunciation of human values and freedom. Rather, he proposes we accept that absurdity is a part of our lives and live with it.     The turning point in Camuss attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the Revue Libre in 1943, the second in the Cahiers de Libération in 1944, and the third in the newspaper Libertés, in 1945. The four letters were published as Lettres à un ami allemand  in 1945, and were included in the collection  Resistance, Rebellion, and Death .     Camus regretted the continued reference to himself as a philosopher of the absurd . He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing Le Mythe de Sisyphe. To distinguish his ideas, scholars sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to Camuss Absurd .         Camus is known for articulating the case for revolting against any kind of oppression, injustice, or whatever disrespects the human condition. He is cautious enough, however, to set the limits on the rebellion. LHomme révolté  explains in detail his thoughts on the issue. There, he builds upon the absurd  but goes further. In the introduction, where he examines the metaphysics of rebellion, he concludes with the phrase I revolt, therefore we exist implying the recognition of a common human condition. Camus also delineates the difference between revolution and rebellion and notices that history has shown that the rebels revolution might easily end up to be an oppressive regime. So he places importance on the morals accompanying the revolution. Camus poses a crucial question: Is it possible for humans to act in an ethical and meaningful manner, in a silent universe? According to him the answer is yes, as the experience and awareness of the Absurd creates the moral values and also sets the limits of our actions. Camus separates the modern form of rebellion into two modes. First, there is the metaphysical rebellion, which is the movement by which man protests against his condition and against the whole of creation. The other mode, historical rebellion, is the attempt to materialize the abstract spirit of metaphysical rebellion and change the world. In this attempt, the rebel must balance between the evil of the world and the intrinsic evil which every revolt carries, and not cause any unjustifiable suffering.
