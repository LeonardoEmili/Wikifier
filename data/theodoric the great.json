His status made him valuable, since the Amal family from which he came , allegedly ruled half of all Goths since the third-century AD. Historian Peter Heather argues that Theodorics claims were likely self-aggrandizing propaganda and that the Amal dynasty was more limited than modern commentators presume.

On his return in 42/42 Theodoric assumed leadership over the Gothic regions previously ruled by his uncle, Valamir, while his father became king. Not long afterwards near Singidunum-Belgrade in upper Moesia, the Tisza Sarmatian king Babai had extended his authority at Constantinoples expense. Legitimizing his position as a warrior, Theodoric crossed the Danube with six-thousand warriors, defeated the Sarmatians and killed Babai; this moment likely crystallized his position and marked the beginning of his kingship, despite not actually having yet assumed the throne. Perhaps to assert his authority as an Amali prince, Theodoric kept the conquered area of Singidunum for himself.     Throughout the 42s, sometimes in the name of the empire itself, Theodoric launched campaigns against potential Gothic rivals and other enemies of the Eastern Empire, which made him an important military and political figure.
