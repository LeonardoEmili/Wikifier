The first is the covenant between God and Noah immediately after the Deluge in which God agrees never again to destroy the Earth with water. The next is between God and Abraham, and the third between God and all Israel at Mount Sinai. In this third covenant, unlike the first two, God hands down an elaborate set of laws , which the Israelites are to observe; they are also to remain faithful to Yahweh, the god of Israel, meaning, among other things, that they must put their trust in his help.     The theme of descendants marks the first event in Numbers, the census of Israels fighting men: the huge number which results demonstrates the fulfillment of Gods promise to Abraham of innumerable descendants, as well as serving as Gods guarantee of victory in Canaan. As chapters 1–10 progress, the theme of Gods presence with Israel comes to the fore: these chapters describe how Israel is to be organized around the Sanctuary, Gods dwelling-place in their midst, under the charge of the Levites and priests, in preparation for the conquest of the land.     The Israelites then set out to conquer the land, but almost immediately they refuse to enter it, and Yahweh condemns the whole generation who left Egypt to die in the wilderness. The message is clear: failure was not due to any fault in the preparation, because Yahweh had foreseen everything, but to Israels sin of unfaithfulness. In the final section, the Israelites of the new generation follow Yahwehs instructions as given through Moses and are successful in all they attempt. The last five chapters are exclusively concerned with land: instructions for the extermination of the Canaanites, the demarcation of the boundaries of the land, how the land is to be divided, holy cities for the Levites and cities of refuge , the problem of pollution of the land by blood, and regulations for inheritance when a male heir is lacking.
