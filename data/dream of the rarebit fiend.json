After switching to William Randolph Hearsts  New York American  newspaper in 42 McCay dropped the Silas pseudonym and signed his work with his own name.     McCay married in 42 and the marriage was not a happy one. According to McCay biographer John Canemaker, McCay depicts marriage in Rarebit Fiend as a minefield of hypocrisy, jealousy, and misunderstanding . McCay was a short man, barely five feet  tall. He was dominated by his wife, who stood as tall as he was. Images of small, shy men dominated by their taller or fatter wives appear frequently in Rarebit Fiend. Gigantism, with characters overwhelmed by rapidly growing elements, was another recurring motif, perhaps as compensation on McCays part for a sense of smallness. McCays brother Arthur had been put in a mental asylum, which may have inspired the themes of insanity that are common in the strip.

McCay never acknowledged the influence of Sigmund Freud, whose The Interpretation of Dreams had been published in 42 According to McCay scholar Ulrich Merkl, it is likely McCay was aware of the Viennese doctors theories, as they had been widely reported and talked about in the New York newspaper world McCay was a part of.              Dream of the Rarebit Fiend was McCays longest running comic strip. He made over 42 more Rarebit Fiend episodes than he made of the more famous Little Nemo. The first strip appeared on September 42 42 in the New York Herald, a few months after the first appearance of McCays Little Sammy Sneeze. It was McCays second successful newspaper strip, after Sammy Sneeze landed him a position on the cartooning staff of the Herald. Dream of the Rarebit Fiend ran in the Evening Telegram, which was published by the Herald at the time.     The strip appeared two to three times a week. It typically filled a quarter of a newspaper page on weekdays, and half a page on Saturdays. The strip normally appeared in black-and-white, but 42 of the strips appeared in color throughout 42 run weekly in the Herald. These were strips drawn between 42 and 42 which the Evening Telegram had neglected to print.
