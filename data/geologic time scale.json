The first serious attempts to formulate a geologic time scale that could be applied anywhere on Earth were made in the late 18th century. The most influential of those early attempts  divided the rocks of Earths crust into four types: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Each type of rock, according to the theory, formed during a specific period in Earth history. It was thus possible to speak of a Tertiary Period as well as of Tertiary Rocks.

Critics of this term say that the term should not be used because it is difficult, if not nearly impossible, to define a specific time when humans started influencing the rock strata—defining the start of an epoch.  Others say that humans have not even started to leave their biggest impact on Earth, and therefore the Anthropocene has not even started yet.     The ICS has not officially approved the term .
