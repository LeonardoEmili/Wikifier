In his review in The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall wrote superb portrayal in a difficult role leaves only the regret that the powers that be did not see fit to have her make her screen début in a more cheerful study...The Sin of Madelon Claudet is a sorrowful chronicle which will undoubtedly have a strong popular appeal. It is endowed with other commendable impersonations... also has the benefit of Edgar Selwyns expert direction.      Time magazine wrote that the film was remarkable because in it Helen Hayes appears in cinema for the first time and because it succeeds in its intention — to make audiences weep...By ceasing entirely to be Helen Hayes and becoming instead the woman whose life story she portrays, Cinemactress Hayes makes the familiarity of the story double its sadness...The picture is well directed by Edgar Selwyn splendidly acted by the rest of the cast.
