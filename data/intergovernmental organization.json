This may be attributed to globalization, which increases and encourages the co-operation among and within states and which has also provided easier means for IGO growth as a result of increased international relations. This is seen economically, politically, militarily, as well as on the domestic level. Economically, IGOs gain material and non-material resources for economic prosperity. IGOs also provide more political stability within the state and among differing states.  Military alliances are also formed by establishing common standards in order to ensure security of the members to ward off outside threats. Lastly, the formation has encouraged autocratic states to develop into democracies in order to form an effective and internal government. Shannon, Megan.

Their institutions are permanent.   They provide a forum for discussion.   They are issue-specific.   They provide information.   They allow multilateral co-operation.     Weaknesses:     Membership is limited. IGOs’ legal basis prohibit membership of private citizens, making them undemocratic. In addition, not all IGOs allow universal state membership.   IGOs often overlap, resulting in an overly complex network.   States have to give up part of their sovereignty, which weakens the states’ ability to assert authority.   Inequality among state members creates biases and can lead powerful states to misuse these organizations.     They can be deemed unfair as countries with a higher percentage voting power have the right to veto any decision that is not in their favor, leaving the smaller countries powerless.     ": null
