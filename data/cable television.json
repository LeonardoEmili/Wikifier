        " became common. By the late 42s, cable-only signals outnumbered broadcast signals on cable systems, some of which by this time had expanded beyond 42 channels. By the mid42s in Canada, cable operators were allowed by the regulators to enter into distribution contracts with cable networks on their own.     By the 42s, tiers became common, with customers able to subscribe to different tiers to obtain different selections of additional channels above the basic selection. By subscribing to additional tiers, customers could get specialty channels, movie channels, and foreign channels. Large cable companies used addressable descramblers to limit access to ": null

During the 42s, the pressure to accommodate the growing array of offerings resulted in digital transmission that made more efficient use of the VHF signal capacity; fibre optics was common to carry signals into areas near the home, where coax could carry higher frequencies over the short remaining distance. Although for a time in the 42s and 42s, television receivers and VCRs were equipped to receive the mid-band and super-band channels.
