He was known for writing about the harsh legacy of colonialism and the complexities of living and writing in two cultural worlds. His poetic voice reflected a blend of his ear for the English language and his sense of his own people. Grimes, William. Derek Walcott, Poet and Nobel Laureate of the Caribbean, Dies at 87. The New York Times, The New York Times, 17 March 2017, www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/books/derek-walcott-dead-nobel-prize-literature.html.     Stephen Breslow explained that he and the Swedish Academy chose Derek Walcott for the Nobel Laureate in Literature because his work had a strong regional voice that transcends its topical locality, through the depth and breadth of its poetic resonance and through its global human implication. It was Walcotts ability to be more than just exotic that brought his work critical attention. Breslow explains that Walcott has merged a profound, rhapsodic reverie upon his remote birthplace – its people, its landscape, and its history – with the central, classical tradition of Western civilization. This ability shows the importance of multiculturalism and literary mastery to the Swedish Academy. Walcotts works represent how different cultures can enrich one another to produce even more compelling works. Breslow, Stephen.      In his Nobel acceptance speech, Walcott describes life on Antilles and what it means to discover identity. He describes all of the broken fragments of his diasporic identity. People need books, he says, but they are not enough to encompass all that a culture is. Walcott says that the visible poetry of the Antilles, then. Survival because all of the Antilles, every island, is an effort of memory; every mind, every racial biography culminating in amnesia and fog. He encompasses the diasporic identity found in Caribbean Literature by looking at how insignificant he feels because he cannot, alone, fully bring together a cultural identity. . Nobel Foundation.

While he praised Walcotts writing in Sea Grapes and The Arkansas Testament, Logan had mostly negative things to say about Walcotts poetry, calling Omeros clumsy and Another Life pretentious. He concluded with No living poet has written verse more delicately rendered or distinguished than Walcott, though few individual poems seem destined to be remembered.

People perceive the world on dual channels, Walcott’s verse suggests, through the senses and through the mind, and each is constantly seeping into the other. The result is a state of perpetual magical thinking, a kind of  Alice in Wonderland  world where concepts have bodies and landscapes are always liable to get up and start talking.      Kirsch calls Another Life Walcotts first major peak and analyzes the painterly qualities of Walcotts imagery from his earliest work through to later books like Tiepolos Hound. He also explores the post-colonial politics in Walcotts work, calling him the postcolonial writer par excellence . Kirsch calls the early poem A Far Cry from Africa a turning point in Walcotts development as a poet. Like Logan, Kirsch is critical of Omeros, which he believes Walcott fails to successfully sustain over its entirety. Although Omeros is the volume of Walcotts that usually receives the most critical praise, Kirsch believes Midsummer to be his best book.
