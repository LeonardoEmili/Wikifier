All dates prior to this are the subject of often vigorous dispute.    After King Nan was deposed by Qin, Ji Jie ,  Duke Wen of the vassal duchy of Eastern Zhou was proclaimed the new king of Zhou and claimed the title until his death in 42 BCE. However, the King of Qin had taken possession of the Nine Tripod Cauldrons  , and Ji Jies reign was not widely recognized. Historians generally considered the title of Son of Heaven to be vacant from 42 to 42 BCE.            Chinese convention: use regnal name     Note: The State of Qin was founded in the 42th century BCE as a vassal of the Zhou dynasty. In 42 BCE, the Duke of Qing, Ying Si , declared himself king and was given the regnal name King Huiwen of Qin . In 42 BCE, King Zhaoxiang of Qin ended the Zhou dynasty, and in 42 BCE, Ying Zheng completed the conquest of the other states and declared himself Qin Shi Huang, or First Emperor of Qin.
