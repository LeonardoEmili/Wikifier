However, forensic examination of his mummy yielded an age at death of no more than 42 years old. This suggests that the cattle count occurred more than once every two years during Unas and Tetis time, possibly irregularly. If so, Unas 42-year figure on the Turin canon, understood to mean 42 cattle counts, could translate into as little as 42 years, which together with just 42 years during Tetis reign would account for Nikau-Isesis death at around 42 to 42 years of age.          ; Trade and warfare   Owing to the scarcity of evidence dating to Unas reign, we know very little about his activities.

    {
        " writes, it was by no means a time of decadence . Indeed, the Egyptian state was still capable of mounting important expeditions to provide building stones for the kings pyramid complex. These expeditions are depicted on unique reliefs found in Unas causeway and are also referred to in the autobiographical stela of an administration official. This official reports the transport of  palmiform columns of red granite from Elephantine to Saqqara in only four days, a feat for which he was praised by the king. In addition to the important construction works undertaken in Saqqara for the construction of his pyramid complex, building activities also took place on Elephantine.     Until 42 the domestic situation during Unas reign was thought to have been disastrous, based on reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex showing emaciated people and thus suggesting times of famine. This changed when excavations at Abusir in 42 yielded similar reliefs in the mortuary complex of Sahure, who reigned at a prosperous time in the early Fifth Dynasty. In addition, research showed that the starving people are likely to be desert dwellers, nomads distinguished by their specific hair-style, rather than Egyptians. Thus, these reliefs are now understood to be standard representations of the generosity of the king towards the destitute and of the hardships of life in the desert regions bordering Egypt rather than referring to actual events.       In his history of Egypt Manetho states that with the death of Unas the Fifth Dynasty came to an end. This may be because Unas died without a male heir, his probable son Unas-Ankh having predeceased him. This might have caused a succession crisis hinted at by the personal name chosen by Teti upon his accession to the throne: Seheteptawy meaning He who reconciles/pacifies the two lands . Tetis claim to the throne could have relied on his marriage to Iput, who may have been a daughter of Unas. This possibility is heavily debated, as the interpretation of Iputs titles that would indicate that she was the daughter of a king is uncertain. Furthermore, the idea that Teti could legitimate his claim by marrying into the royal family is rejected by many Egyptologists, including Munro, Dobrev, ": null

In addition to Manethos statement, the Turin king list presents a special break point between Unas and his successor Teti.   Although the king list is not organized in dynasties & ndash;which were invented by Manetho & ndash;the Egyptologist Jaromir Malek explains that the criterion for such divisions in the Turin Canon invariably was the change of location of the capital and royal residence.  Malek thus suggests that the capital of Egypt, then known as Inbu-Hedj, was indeed supplanted at the time by settlements located to the South, East of South Saqqara, where Unas palace may have been located.

At the end of the causeway was a large hall leading to a pillared open court surrounded by magazine chambers. The court led into the mortuary temple proper which housed statues of the king and where the offerings to the deceased took place.

Pyramid Texts      The main innovation of the pyramid of Unas is the first appearance of the  Pyramid Texts , one of the oldest religious texts in Egypt to have survived to this day. In doing so, Unas initiated a tradition that would be followed in the pyramid of the kings and queens of the Sixth to Eighth Dynasties, until the end of the Old Kingdom circa 42 years later.     In total 42 magical spells, also known as utterances, were carved and the signs painted blue on the walls of the corridor, antechamber, and burial chamber of Unas pyramid.

Hence, the Pyramid Texts of the pyramid of Unas incorporate instructions for ritual actions and words to be spoken, suggesting that they were precisely those performed and recited during the cult of the king in his mortuary temple.
